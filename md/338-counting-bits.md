### Leetcode 338 (Easy): Counting Bits [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits)

### Description  
Given a non-negative integer **n**, return an array `ans` of length **n + 1** such that `ans[i]` is the number of 1s (also called *set bits*) in the binary representation of **i**, for every integer **i** in the range 0 to **n** (inclusive). This effectively means: for every number from 0 up to **n**, calculate how many bits are set to 1 in its binary format.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 5`  
Output: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`  
*Explanation:*
- 0 → 0 (0 one)
- 1 → 1 (1 one)
- 2 → 10 (1 one)
- 3 → 11 (2 ones)
- 4 → 100 (1 one)
- 5 → 101 (2 ones)

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 2`  
Output: `[0, 1, 1]`  
*Explanation:*
- 0 → 0 (0 one)
- 1 → 1 (1 one)
- 2 → 10 (1 one)

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 0`  
Output: ``  
*Explanation:*
- 0 → 0 (0 one)

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The brute-force way is to convert each integer from **0** to **n** into a binary string, then count the ‘1’s. This would result in \(O(\text{N} \log \text{N})\) since converting to binary for each number and counting takes \(\log n\) time for number **n**.
- But we notice that counting bits for a number is very related to previously computed numbers. Specifically, the number of **1**s in **i** equals **1 + number of 1s in i & (i - 1)** (where *&* is bitwise AND), because *i & (i - 1)* removes the lowest set bit.
- That means we can use **dynamic programming**: For every index **i** (`1` to `n`), we set `ans[i] = ans[i & (i - 1)] + 1`. We already will have computed `ans[i & (i - 1)]` since that number is less than **i**.
- This significantly reduces the work and is \(O(n)\) in time.

### Corner cases to consider  
- **n = 0** (edge case, only one result)
- Very large values of **n** (memory usage)
- Ensure the 0 case produces ``
- Numbers that are exactly a power of two (should give `1` as their answer)
- Consecutive numbers with many bits changing (e.g. from 7 to 8)

### Solution

```python
def countBits(n: int) -> list[int]:
    # Initialize output list for 0 and all numbers up to n
    ans = [0] * (n + 1)

    # Loop through every number from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # For number i, count bits as 1 + bits in i with lowest set bit removed
        ans[i] = ans[i & (i - 1)] + 1

    return ans
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), since we iterate from 1 to n and each operation in the loop is \(O(1)\) (single bit manipulation and array lookup).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\), as we store one integer count for each number from 0 to n in the output list.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How could you solve this if you were not allowed to use extra space, i.e., only constant space?
  *Hint: Can you print the result incrementally or use bitwise tricks on the fly?*

- What if you wanted to output the position of set bits instead of the count for every number?
  *Hint: Think about returning a list of lists, using popcount or other bit operations.*

- Can you generalize this to other bases or different counting functions (for example, counting zeros)?
  *Hint: Adapt your DP transition or how you compute bit composition.*

### Summary
This problem leverages the **dynamic programming** pattern where results for previous numbers are reused to compute the next, thanks to properties of bit manipulation. The key formula is:  
`ans[i] = ans[i & (i - 1)] + 1`  
which efficiently reduces the bit counting for each number to constant time.  
This pattern (reuse of subproblem solutions and bitmask operations) appears in many bit manipulation and state compression DP problems, such as counting set bits, finding masks, or determining subsets.
