### Leetcode 3229 (Hard): Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal to Target [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-equal-to-target)

### Description  
You are given two positive integer arrays **nums** and **target**, both of equal length. In one operation, you can choose any subarray (contiguous segment) of **nums** and increment or decrement every element in that subarray by 1. Your goal is to compute the **minimum number of such operations required to transform nums so that it becomes exactly equal to target**.  
For each operation, you can choose any subarray, and each step only adds or subtracts 1 from all selected elements.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [3,5,1,2]`, `target = [4,6,2,4]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:  
- Operation 1: Increment all (entire array) by 1 → [4,6,2,3]  
- Operation 2: Increment last element (subarray [3]) by 1 → [4,6,2,4]  
3 operations in total.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1,3,3,2]`, `target = [3,1,1,2]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation:  
- Operation 1: Increment element 0 ([1]) by 1 → [2,3,3,2]  
- Operation 2: Increment element 0 ([2]) by 1 → [3,3,3,2]  
- Operation 3: Decrement subarray [1,2] ([3,3]) by 1 → [3,2,2,2]  
- Operation 4: Decrement subarray [1,2] ([2,2]) by 1 → [3,1,1,2]*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [2,2,2]`, `target = [2,2,2]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation:  
Arrays are already equal, so 0 operations are required.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, I note the key operation: we can increment or decrement any subarray by 1 per operation, as many times as we want.

Brute-force approach:  
- Simulate increment/decrement for all possible subarrays until nums equals target, but this would be exponential and infeasible for large arrays.

Instead, I try to reframe:  
- Let’s compute the **difference array**: diff[i] = target[i] - nums[i].
- Our task reduces to making the diff array all zeros using minimum operations, where each operation lets me increment/decrement a subarray by 1.

Here’s the main trick:  
- Visualize the difference array as a sequence. For every index, if the required delta changes compared to the previous index, we must “start a new push.”
- So, the minimal number of operations is sum over abs(diff[i] - diff[i-1]) for all 1 ≤ i < n, and add abs(diff) for the first.
- The intuition is similar to flattening a histogram: each time the target “changes direction” or the difference increases beyond the previous, we need more operations.

This is both optimal and O(n) time.

### Corner cases to consider  
- nums and target are already equal (returns 0).
- Single-element arrays.
- Large arrays with maximum possible difference.
- Consecutive diff values with same sign (should not double count).
- Empty input arrays (though constraints guarantee nonempty? Still, check as best practice).
- Negative deltas (target < nums).

### Solution

```python
def minimumOperations(nums, target):
    n = len(nums)
    # Compute the difference array
    diff = [target[i] - nums[i] for i in range(n)]
    # The minimal number of operations is abs(diff[0]) + sum(abs(diff[i] - diff[i-1]))
    operations = abs(diff[0])
    for i in range(1, n):
        operations += abs(diff[i] - diff[i-1])
    return operations
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), since we loop through the arrays once to compute differences and once more to sum up the deltas.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the difference array. If modifying in place, could be O(1) extra.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Suppose instead of +1 or -1, you could add/subtract any integer per operation. How would this change the problem?  
  *Hint: Think about greedy groupings where possible, since bigger steps could be better.*

- What if the allowed subarrays must be of fixed length k (rather than arbitrary)?  
  *Hint: Would require sliding window or DP because some positions can now only be affected by certain intervals.*

- Can you count how many ways (not minimal) you can achieve the transformation?  
  *Hint: Think about how many different groupings of increments lead to the same result.*

### Summary
This problem uses a **difference array** and a **greedy prefix approach** to count the minimal number of subarray operations required. The usage pattern is common for any scenario where subarray modifications must sum up to a “staircase” of differences — e.g., histogram flattening or painting problems. It highlights careful reduction to 1D delta processing and sequence transitions. Variants on this theme appear in range-update/monotonic array problems and have deep ties to greedy and prefix sum methods.
