### Leetcode 3091 (Medium): Apply Operations to Make Sum of Array Greater Than or Equal to k [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-make-sum-of-array-greater-than-or-equal-to-k)

### Description  
You're given an array starting with a single integer: `[1]`. You can perform two types of operations any number of times:

- **Increase operation**: Pick any element and increase its value by 1.
- **Duplicate operation**: Pick any element and append a copy of it to the end of the array.

Your goal is to make the **sum** of the array **greater than or equal to** a given integer `k`, using the minimum number of operations.  
Return the **minimum number of operations** needed.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `k = 11`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation: One optimal way:  
- Increase 1 → 2 (now [2]), operations=1  
- Duplicate 2 → [2,2], operations=2  
- Duplicate 2 → [2,2,2], operations=3  
- Duplicate 2 → [2,2,2,2], operations=4  
- Now sum([2,2,2,2]) = 8  
- Increase any 2 → 3 ([3,2,2,2]), sum=9  
- Duplicate 3 ([3,2,2,2,3]), sum=12, total operations=5  
But the optimal sequence (as explained in solutions) is:  
- Increase 1 → 3 (steps: 2 increments, now [3])  
- Duplicate three times to get [3,3,3,3], now sum=12, operations=5.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `k = 6`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:  
- Increase 1 → 2 ([2]), operations=1  
- Duplicate twice ([2,2,2]), operations=3  
- sum([2,2,2]) = 6 ≥ k.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `k = 1`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: The initial array sum is already 1, so 0 operations are needed.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First instinct: brute-force all possible sequences of increments/duplicates, simulating until sum ≥ k.  
But that’s exponential—unmanageable for large k.

Notice:
- The order of operations can be separated:  
  - You can increment the initial value several times, then duplicate it several times (since duplicates just add that value).
- For any target sum, maximum efficiency is often achieved by balancing: increment to x, then duplicate as few times as needed for x × (#elements) ≥ k.

So, for any number of increments a (making the element x = a+1),  
we want the minimum number of duplications b such that x × (b+1) ≥ k  
→ b = ⎡k/x⎤ - 1

Total operations = a + b

Iterate a from 0 up to k (not more needed), compute x, b, and keep the minimum result.

This greedy-combinatorial approach trims search space from exponential to linear in k.

### Corner cases to consider  
- k = 1: already satisfied, needs 0 operations.
- k is very large: handle integer overflow, but logic remains.
- For small k, ensure method doesn't over-count necessary operations.
- Minimum operations may be all increments (no duplicates needed).

### Solution

```python
def minOperations(k: int) -> int:
    res = k  # Worst case: k-1 increments and no dups
    for inc in range(k):
        x = 1 + inc  # Value after inc increments
        dup = (k + x - 1) // x - 1  # ceil(k/x) - 1
        res = min(res, inc + dup)
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(k).  
  For each possible increase step (from 0 to k-1), we do constant work; hence, O(k) overall.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1).  
  Only a few integer variables; no auxiliary storage increasing with input.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the starting array contains other numbers instead of only `[1]`?  
  *Hint: Generalize the process for each initial value.*

- What if each duplication costs two operations instead of one?  
  *Hint: Adjust operation counting in the equation accordingly.*

- Can you optimize further for very large k (k ≥ 10⁸)?  
  *Hint: Consider analytical approaches to avoid linear search.*

### Summary
This is an **enumeration and greedy pattern**: try all ways to combine basic atomic operations, then choose the best. The approach is mathematically efficient and avoids state explosion, which is common in DP or simulation problems.  
The pattern—minimizing combined operations by balancing increases and duplications—applies for similar construction or build-up problems in combinatorics and greedy algorithms.
