### Leetcode 1945 (Easy): Sum of Digits of String After Convert [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-of-string-after-convert)

### Description  
Given a string **s** of lowercase English letters and an integer **k**:  
1. Replace every letter in **s** with its position in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' → 1, 'b' → 2, …, 'z' → 26), forming a single large string of digits.  
2. Then, treat this as a string of digits, and perform **k** transformations:  
   - In each, sum all the digits, and replace with the new total (as a string, for the next step).
Repeat this for **k** times total, and return the result as an integer.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "zbax", k = 2`  
Output: `8`  
*Explanation: "z"=26, "b"=2, "a"=1, "x"=24 → "262124".  
First transform: 2+6+2+1+2+4=17.  
Second transform: 1+7=8.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "leetcode", k = 2`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation: "l"=12, "e"=5, ... gives "12552031545".  
First: 1+2+5+5+2+0+3+1+5+4+5=33.  
Second: 3+3=6.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = "a", k = 1`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: "a"=1.  
Only one transformation. Sum is 1.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, each character is mapped to its 1-based alphabet index. To concatenate, I’d get a string: for instance, 'z' is '26', so the mapping is *variable-length*.  
After mapping, I need to sum the digits **k** times. Summing digits is straightforward: either via conversion to integers or using string processing.  

- **Brute-force:**  
  Build the result string from s, then loop k times, summing all digits each iteration.  
  To optimize: No need for more elaborate logic because input is short (s ≤ 100).

- For each character `ch` in `s`:
    - Compute alphabet position: `ord(ch) - ord('a') + 1`
    - Concatenate string.
- For k iterations: 
    - Sum all digits (loop through the string, convert each to int, sum).
    - Convert back to string for next round (except the last).

No extra optimization necessary due to problem constraints (O(n⋅k), n small).

### Corner cases to consider  
- **Single character** (e.g., s = "a", k arbitrary)  
- **k = 1** or **k > 1**
- **All letters are 'z'** ("zzzz"→ "26262626")  
- **Mapped values producing a string with '0'** (e.g., 'j'=10)  
- **k greater than number of digits**, so result stabilizes quickly.  
- **s is maximum length (100 letters)**

### Solution

```python
def getLucky(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Convert each character to its position in the alphabet and concatenate
    digits = ''
    for ch in s:
        # 'a' -> 1, ..., 'z' -> 26
        digits += str(ord(ch) - ord('a') + 1)
    
    # Step 2: Apply the sum-of-digits transformation k times
    for _ in range(k):
        total = 0
        for d in digits:
            total += int(d)
        digits = str(total)
    
    return int(digits)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + k·m), where n = len(s), m = number of digits after step 1 (`≤ 200`).
  - Building the mapped string is O(n).
  - Each digit sum pass (up to k times) takes up to O(m). Both n, m, and k are small.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m) for the string of digits, O(1) extra space for variables.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if **s** could contain non-lowercase characters?  
  *Hint: Consider filtering or error-handling for invalid input.*

- What if **k** was very large?  
  *Hint: Does the value stabilize, and is there a way to shortcut iterations?*

- Could you do step 1 and the first sum in a single loop?  
  *Hint: Aggregate the sum while mapping the characters, potentially skipping the initial concatenation.*

### Summary
You map each character to its alphabet position to get a long digit string, then repeat sum-of-digits transformations. This is a **simulation problem** involving character encoding and repeated digital sum, showing up in digital root and digit manipulation tasks. The pattern is applicable to problems involving repeated transformation or simulations with small constraints.
