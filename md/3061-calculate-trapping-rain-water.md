### Leetcode 3061 (Hard): Calculate Trapping Rain Water [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-trapping-rain-water)

### Description  
Given an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water can be trapped after raining.  
At each index, the amount of trapped water depends on the height of the tallest bar to its left and right, since water can only be held between two taller boundaries. The trapped water at a position is the difference between the smaller of the two maximums (left/right) and the height at that position.  

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation: Water is trapped at various indices: (2 → 1), (4 → 1), (5 → 2), (6 → 1), (8 → 1). That sums to 6 total.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `[4,2,0,3,2,5]`  
Output: `9`  
*Explanation: Water accumulates at index 1 (2), 2 (4), 4 (1), totaling 9.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `[2,0,2]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Water is trapped in index 1 (2).*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
To start, I would loop through each element and, for every position, search left and right to find the maximum height boundaries. The minimum of these two heights (minus the height at the current index) gives how much water can be trapped.  

However, searching left/right for each position is O(n²), which is too slow for large input.  
A standard optimization involves precomputing two arrays:  
- `max_left[i]`: max height to the left of and including i  
- `max_right[i]`: max height to the right of and including i  

After precomputing `max_left` and `max_right` in two linear passes, I can calculate the water at each bar in a final pass.

For O(1) space, I can use two pointers from left and right ends with variables for running maxes, accumulating trapped water in one traversal.

I would use the two-pointer solution as it's optimal for both time and space.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty array input (`[]`)  
- All heights are zero or no pit formed (flat terrain)  
- Heights are strictly increasing or decreasing  
- Only one or two bars  
- Gaps between bars but the boundary at ends is the same height  
- Maximum possible input size (tests efficiency)

### Solution

```python
def trap(height):
    # Edge case: empty array or too few bars
    if not height or len(height) < 3:
        return 0

    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    left_max = right_max = 0
    total_water = 0

    # Two-pointer solution
    while left < right:
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            # Water trapped at left depends on left_max
            if height[left] >= left_max:
                left_max = height[left]
            else:
                total_water += left_max - height[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            # Water trapped at right depends on right_max
            if height[right] >= right_max:
                right_max = height[right]
            else:
                total_water += right_max - height[right]
            right -= 1

    return total_water
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), with n = number of bars. Each index is visited at most once from either left or right.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space, as we use only variables to keep running maximums and indices. (No extra arrays.)

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if negative heights are allowed?  
  *Hint: Think about implications for rainwater trapping and physical meaning of negative heights.*

- How would you handle if the width between bars varies?  
  *Hint: Modify the formula for the trapped water at each index.*

- Can you generalize this for a 2D grid (trapping rain water II)?  
  *Hint: What property of the 2-pointer solution is hard to generalize to higher dimensions?*

### Summary
This problem is a classic application of the two-pointer technique, often called the "two-pass" or "trapping water" pattern. You start with brute force, optimize with precomputation, then solve in O(1) space with running max trackers. This pattern is broadly useful for interval problems, sliding windows, and anywhere you need to compare prefix/suffix extremes or efficiently aggregate across an array.
