### Leetcode 3675 (Medium): Minimum Operations to Transform String [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-transform-string)

### Description  
You are given a string **s** consisting of only lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can choose a character **c** and replace every occurrence of **c** with the next letter in the English alphabet (wrapping 'z'→'a'). Return the minimum number of operations required to transform **s** into a string consisting only of 'a'.  
- *Example*: If s = "abc", you can choose 'b' and replace all 'b' with 'c' in one operation, or choose 'z' and replace occurrences with 'a', etc.
- All changes apply to **all occurrences** of a character per operation.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "yz"`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation:  
- First, choose 'z' → Replace 'z' with 'a': s = "ya" (Operation 1)
- Then, choose 'y' → Replace 'y' with 'z': s = "za" (Operation 2)
- Now, choose 'z' again, but since we've already performed 2 operations and every time we convert, the set of unique non-'a' letters reduces.  
- Alternatively, note that each unique character (other than 'a') is part of a cycle to transform back to 'a'.  
- In this example, 2 steps: 'z'→'a', 'y'→'z' (then 'z'→'a' again).

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "ababa"`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation:  
- The unique letters are 'a' and 'b' (ignore 'a', since it's already our target).
- First, choose 'b' → Replace all 'b' with 'c': s = "acaca"
- Then, choose 'c' → Replace all 'c' with 'd': s = "adada"
- Keep repeating until every 'b' has wrapped around to 'a', but the minimal operations needed equals 1 for each unique non-'a' character.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = "a"`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation:  
- The string already consists of only 'a', so no operations are needed.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, notice that each step lets you pick a letter and change all its occurrences to the *next* letter (modulo 26, so 'z' becomes 'a').  
To make the whole string 'a', we repeatedly need to increment all letters to 'a'. But:  
- Each operation works on all instances of a letter at once (so we focus on unique letters in the string).
- Once a letter becomes 'a', we no longer need to touch it.

Brute-force idea:
- Simulate the process, keep applying operations until the string is all 'a'. This will be slow for long inputs.

Optimized approach:
- Observe that the minimum number of operations is the count of unique *non-'a'* letters in the string. 
  - For input "yz": unique non-'a' letters are 'y' and 'z' → need 2 rounds: first change 'z'→'a', then 'y'→'z'(then 'z'→'a').
  - Each operation reduces the maximum "distance" any letter is from 'a', looping through the alphabet.
- Each operation can optimally process all letters at a certain "distance" at once by progressing all towards 'a'.

So, track for each unique non-'a' letter, how many times it needs to be replaced, and the overall answer is the number of those unique letters.  
- Each time, process the "furthest" from 'a' first (e.g., letters closest to 'z' coming back to 'a').

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty string: "" → Should return 0.
- String with all 'a's.
- String with all 26 letters.
- Letters already 'a' should never be operated upon.
- Characters with wrap-around: like 'z', or a string with 'a' and 'z'.
- No duplicate non-'a' characters vs all identical non-'a' characters.
- Very large input (length up to 10⁵ to test performance).

### Solution

```python
def minimumOperations(s: str) -> int:
    # Set to store all unique non-'a' characters
    unique = set()
    for ch in s:
        if ch != 'a':
            unique.add(ch)
    # The minimum number of operations is just the count of unique non-'a' letters
    return len(unique)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string s.  
  - We must scan every character once to detect unique letters.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  - Because there are at most 26 lowercase letters, the set stores at most 25 non-'a' characters (constant space).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If instead of converting to 'a', you have to convert to any arbitrary fixed character?  
  *Hint: Should handle other target letters—change the character you're comparing against.*

- What if the letter replacement step was not circular (i.e., after 'z', you cannot wrap to 'a')?  
  *Hint: Would require more careful increment logic, possibly early stopping if impossible.*

- What if you could only replace one occurrence at a time, not all at once?  
  *Hint: Then you'd need to track the total number of required individual replacements, which could be much larger.*

### Summary
This problem is an instance of *counting unique elements* under a specific operation constraint (batch updates of characters in a string).  
The optimal greedy solution is to process all unique non-'a' characters, with each operation transforming all of one letter closer to the target 'a', utilizing a set to deduplicate work.  
This pattern—minimizing steps via "grouping by unique value"—shows up in other batch-transformation, set-based interval, or bucket-type problems as well.
