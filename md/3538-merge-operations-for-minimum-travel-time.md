### Leetcode 3538 (Hard): Merge Operations for Minimum Travel Time [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-operations-for-minimum-travel-time)

### Description  
You are given:
- An integer **l** (the total length of the road in kilometers).
- An integer **n** (the number of road signs placed at increasing positions, including at 0 and l), where **position=0** and **position[n-1]=l**.
- An integer **k**, the number of merge operations you *must* perform.
- Arrays **position** (length n; the km-positions of the signs, strictly increasing from 0 to l) and **time** (length n-1; time[i] is the minutes to travel per km between position[i] and position[i+1]).

Each merge operation removes **one** of the signs (except the first and last), combining its adjacent intervals and summing their time-per-km rates. After performing **exactly k merges**, return the *minimum total travel time in minutes* to traverse the road from 0 to l.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
`l = 10`, `n = 4`, `k = 1`, `position = [0, 3, 8, 10]`, `time = [2, 1, 3]`  
Output:  
`22`  
Explanation:  
- Initial segments: [0-3](2), [3-8](1), [8-10](3)
- Merge segments at position 3 (indices 1 and 2): Combine [3-8](1) and [8-10](3) → [3-10](1+3=4)
- Segments after merge: [0-3](2), [3-10](4)
- Total travel time: (3-0)×2 + (10-3)×4 = 3×2 + 7×4 = 6 + 28 = **34**

Wait, but we can also merge [0-3] and [3-8]:  
- [0-8](2+1=3), [8-10](3)
- Total: (8-0)×3 + (10-8)×3 = 8×3 + 2×3 = 24 + 6 = **30**

But the optimal is not to perform the merge? Let's check the reference:

From the examples in [5]:  
l = 10, n = 4, k = 1, position = [0,3,8,10], time = [2,1,3]  
After merging [3-8] and [8-10]:  
- [0,3](2), [3,10](1+3=4) → 3×2 + 7×4 = 6+28 = 34  
Else if merge [0,3] and [3,8]:  
- [0,8](2+1=3), [8,10](3) → 8×3 + 2×3 = 24+6 = 30

So the answer is **30**.

**Example 2:**  
Input:  
`l = 20`, `n = 5`, `k = 2`, `position = [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]`, `time = [2, 3, 2, 4]`  
Output:  
`76`  
Explanation:  
- Must merge 2 signs.
- Optimal merges: merge [10,15] and [15,20]:  
  - [15,20](4) + [10,15](2) = 6, so [10,20](6)  
  - Now merge [5,10] and [10,20] (3+6=9): [5,20](9)
  - Segments: [0,5](2), [5,20](9)
  - Travel time: (5-0)×2 + (20-5)×9 = 10 + 135 = **145**
- Try different merge orders for optimal result. (You would need DP for this.)

**Example 3:**  
Input:  
`l = 6`, `n = 3`, `k = 1`, `position = [0, 3, 6]`, `time = [3, 2]`  
Output:  
`21`  
Explanation:  
- Only merge: [0,3] and [3,6] → [0,6](3+2=5)
- Travel time: (6-0)×5 = **30**

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- Start with brute force: Try every possible sequence of k merges, recalculate total time after each, and pick minimum. But the number of ways to merge is combinatorial—impractical for n large.
- Notice that merges only happen between adjacent signs, and each merge changes the length and time-per-km of the affected segment.
- Think in terms of **DP**:
  - Let DP(i, j): minimal cost to merge from positions i to j, with a fixed number of merges.
  - Since the merge process is similar to the "optimal binary search tree" or "min cost to merge stones" pattern, try DP with memoization: (start index, end index, merges left).
- Alternate thought: Since each merge only joins two segments, constrain merges to adjacent segments, and after each merge, recalculate the time as sum.

- **Key approach:** Use DP with state (left, right, merges):
  - dp(left, right, m): Min cost to reduce [left, right] to right-left+1-m segments (i.e., m merges).
  - Try all possible merges at each step and combine their results.

- Trade-off: The DP is O(n³k). With memoization and pruning, this fits for n ~ 50.

### Corner cases to consider  
- k = 0 (no merges): just sum length × time for each segment.
- k = n-2 (merge to just one segment): must merge exactly k times.
- Segments with equal times.
- position spacing of 1 or with large gaps.
- Only one road sign (n=2).
- Impossible cases (if k > n-2).
- Multiple merges on the same position.

### Solution

```python
def minTravelTime(l, n, k, position, time):
    # segments[i]: start at position[i], end at position[i+1], time per km is time[i]
    from functools import lru_cache

    # Precompute segment lengths for convenience
    lens = [position[i+1] - position[i] for i in range(n-1)]

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def dp(times, merges):
        # times: tuple of current times per km for the segments
        # merges: number of merges left to perform
        segs = len(times)
        if merges == 0:
            # No more merges; compute total cost
            total = 0
            idx = 0
            for t in times:
                total += lens[idx] * t
                idx += 1
            return total

        min_total = float('inf')
        # Try every possible adjacent pair to merge
        for i in range(segs - 1):
            # Merge times[i] and times[i+1]
            new_times = list(times)
            new_times[i] = times[i] + times[i+1]
            del new_times[i+1]
            # Recurse
            cost = dp(tuple(new_times), merges - 1)
            min_total = min(min_total, cost)
        return min_total

    return dp(tuple(time), k)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(C(n-1, k) × (n-1) × k), due to the DP branching at every possible merge and every state (segments left, merges left). In practice, for n up to 13 this is fast; for higher n, state pruning or iterative improvements can help.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(C(n-1, k)) for the DP cache, since each subproblem stores a tuple of current times/indices, plus O(n) for temporary lists.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you only need *any* cost ≤ threshold, not minimal?  
  *Hint: Try early exits or greedy merges for speed-up.*

- If you want to minimize the *maximum* travel time for any segment, not the sum?  
  *Hint: Focus merge operations to balance segment times, not just total.*

- How would you optimize for larger n (say, n = 1000)?  
  *Hint: Look for patterns or use greedy merges, or approximate.*

### Summary
This problem uses the **merge intervals with cost minimization** pattern, combining interval DP and memoization. It's similar to interval DP patterns in "Minimum Cost to Merge Stones," where you minimize the total cost via optimal sequence of merges. This technique applies to problems where merge order and grouping matter, such as optimal BST, file merging, or chain matrix multiplication.
