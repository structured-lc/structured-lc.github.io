### Leetcode 2068 (Easy): Check Whether Two Strings are Almost Equivalent [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-whether-two-strings-are-almost-equivalent)

### Description  
Given two strings word1 and word2, both of the same length, determine if they are **almost equivalent**. Two strings are almost equivalent if, for every letter from 'a' to 'z', the absolute difference in that letter's frequency between word1 and word2 is **at most 3**.  
In other words, for each character, check: |frequency in word1 − frequency in word2| ≤ 3.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `word1 = "aaaa"`, `word2 = "bccb"`  
Output: `false`  
*Explanation: 'a' appears 4 times in word1 and 0 times in word2; difference is 4 (>3).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `word1 = "abcdeef"`, `word2 = "abaaacc"`  
Output: `true`  
*Explanation:  
For every letter:  
- 'a': |2-3| = 1  
- 'b': |1-1| = 0  
- 'c': |1-2| = 1  
- 'd': |1-0| = 1  
- 'e': |2-0| = 2  
- 'f': |1-0| = 1  
All differences ≤3.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `word1 = "cccddabba"`, `word2 = "babababab"`  
Output: `true`  
*Explanation:  
Frequency difference for each letter ('a' to 'z') is at most 3.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute force idea:**  
  For every character from 'a' to 'z', count its frequency in both words, then check if any absolute frequency difference exceeds 3.  
  This means 26 iterations, each counting the frequency in both strings—a total time of O(26 × n), which is O(n).

- **Optimized approach:**  
  Instead of counting each letter individually for each word (which would result in redundant passes), use two arrays (or one, by incrementing for word1 and decrementing for word2) of size 26 to record the frequency differences.
  
  For each character in word1: increment its counter.  
  For each character in word2: decrement its counter.  
  Then check if every counter is ≤3 in absolute value.
  
  This reduces passes through the string and is efficient in both time and space.

- The counter-array approach is preferred: it's efficient, easy to implement, and avoids using extra modules.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Both strings empty: should be true; all diffs are zero.
- All letters the same: should be true; all diffs zero.
- One or more letters with frequency difference exactly 4: should be false.
- One word contains letters not present in the other.
- Strings with non-overlapping alphabets (e.g., word1 = "aaa", word2 = "bbb").
- Single-character strings.
- Very large but equal-length strings.

### Solution

```python
def checkAlmostEquivalent(word1, word2):
    # Initialize an array for all 26 lowercase letters.
    freq = [0] * 26

    # Update the frequency for letters in word1.
    for ch in word1:
        freq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1

    # Subtract the frequency for letters in word2.
    for ch in word2:
        freq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] -= 1

    # Check that the absolute diff does not exceed 3 for any letter.
    for diff in freq:
        if abs(diff) > 3:
            return False

    return True
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of each string, since we make one pass through each string, and a final constant-time pass (26 steps) over the frequency array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the frequency array size (26) is constant, regardless of input size.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the strings could include uppercase and lowercase letters?  
  *Hint: Should you handle letter casing? How would that change your storage size or logic?*

- How would your solution change if you want to check for k-difference with an arbitrary k as input?  
  *Hint: Where would you change the code to allow for a dynamic threshold?*

- Can this be extended to Unicode characters or arbitrary character sets?  
  *Hint: Would your fixed-size array still work, or do you need a different data structure?*

### Summary
This problem uses the **counting pattern**, specifically character frequency counting for string comparison within a fixed tolerance. The counter-array technique is **extremely common** for problems involving bounded alphabets, such as anagrams or frequency analysis tasks. It provides an efficient and clear solution that generalizes well for similar string-comparison challenges.
