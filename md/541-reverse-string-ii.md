### Leetcode 541 (Easy): Reverse String II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii)

### Description  
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for every 2*k characters in the string.  
- For every segment of 2*k characters, reverse only the first `k` characters; leave the next `k` characters as is.
- If there are fewer than `k` characters left in the segment at the end, reverse all of them.
- If there are between `k` and `2k` remaining, reverse the first `k` and leave the rest.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "abcdefg", k = 2`  
Output: `"bacdfeg"`  
*Explanation:*
- Segments: "ab" → "ba", "cd" → "dc", "efg": less than 2*k and more than k, so reverse only "e" and "f" → "fe".  
Final: "ba" + "cd" + "fe" + "g" = "bacdfeg"

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "abcd", k = 2`  
Output: `"bacd"`  
*Explanation:*
- First 2*k = 4 characters. Reverse first "ab" → "ba", "cd" remains.  
Final: "ba" + "cd" = "bacd"

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = "abcdefg", k = 8`  
Output: `"gfedcba"`  
*Explanation:*
- The string is shorter than k, so reverse the entire string.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
I’d start by dividing the string into chunks of 2*k. For each chunk:
- Reverse the first k characters.
- Leave the next k characters as is.
To do this in-place, I’d convert the string to a list of characters (since strings are immutable in Python).
Iterate over the string, in steps of 2*k, and reverse the interval [i : i+k). For the last bits (when less than k are left), reverse whatever remains.  
Brute-force is fine here, as we scan and reverse substrings at each window efficiently. Time and space constraints allow this.  
Edge cases to consider: if remaining chars < k (reverse all) or between k and 2k (reverse first k, leave rest).

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty string (`s = ""`)
- k = 1 (every character gets reversed alone)
- k greater than s’s length (reverse entire string)
- s length exactly multiple of 2k
- s length is not a multiple of 2k (last chunk incomplete)
- String with all identical characters

### Solution

```python
def reverseStr(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    s = list(s)  # Strings are immutable, so work with a list

    for i in range(0, len(s), 2 * k):
        # Set start and end indices for reversing
        left = i
        # Don't go out of range if fewer than k characters remain
        right = min(i + k - 1, len(s) - 1)

        # Reverse the first k characters in [left, right]
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1

    return ''.join(s)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.  
  We visit each character exactly once and at most k swaps per segment, so it’s linear.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to strings being immutable in Python (list conversion), but in-place within the array.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would the solution change if you had to reverse in-place for a mutable string type?
  *Hint: Carefully manage indices and use swap logic, no need to allocate extra memory for the string.*

- How would you modify this to reverse the last k characters of every 2k block?
  *Hint: Adjust your window and the position of the reversal in each step.*

- Can you generalize this solution for any interval, not just 2k?
  *Hint: Parameterize the step size and window for reversals.*

### Summary
This approach uses a **sliding window** and **in-place reversal** in fixed-size chunks—a common pattern for string manipulation problems. Similar logic can be applied to “Reverse Words in a String”, work with intervals in arrays, or applying transformations to every nth segment in a sequence. This is a classic case of segmenting and processing in-place.
