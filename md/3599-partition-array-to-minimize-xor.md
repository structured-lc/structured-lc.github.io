### Leetcode 3599 (Medium): Partition Array to Minimize XOR [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-to-minimize-xor)

### Description  
Given an integer array **nums** and an integer **k**, partition the array into **k** non-empty contiguous subarrays.  
For each subarray, compute the bitwise XOR of all its elements.  
Return the minimum possible value of the **maximum** XOR among these **k** subarrays.

Restated: Partition nums into k segments. Take the XOR for each segment. Among those k XORs, the largest is the "maximum XOR" for that partitioning. Out of all ways to partition, return the minimum possible value of this "maximum XOR".

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3], k = 2`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Partition at index 1: [1] | [2,3] → XORs: 1, (2⊕3)=1; max=1.  
Partition at index 2: [1,2] | [3] → XORs: (1⊕2)=3, 3; max=3.  
Answer is min(1,3)=1.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [5,3,8,2], k = 2`  
Output: `11`  
*Explanation: Possible splits —  
[5] | [3,8,2] → XORs: 5, (3⊕8⊕2)=13; max=13  
[5,3] | [8,2] → (5⊕3)=6, (8⊕2)=10; max=10  
[5,3,8] | [2] → (5⊕3⊕8)=14, 2; max=14  
Answer is min(13,10,14)=10.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [7,9,4,6], k = 3`  
Output: `9`  
*Explanation: Try all ways to split into 3 parts.  
 |  | [4,6] → XORs: 7,9,(4⊕6)=2 → max=9  
... (other ways give higher maximums)*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute Force:**  
  - Try every way to split nums into k contiguous groups.
  - For each partition: calculate the XOR for each group, note the largest.
  - Keep track of MIN of all such maximum-XOR values.
  - But: # of partitions is exponential, not feasible for n up to 200.

- **Recursive DP:**  
  - Define dp(i, k): minimum possible value of the maximum-XOR, for starting at index i with k partitions left.
  - For every position j>i: try splitting at index j (nums[i:j]), compute XOR, recurse on the rest.
  - For each split, take max(XOR of this part, dp(j, k-1)). Minimize over all j.
  - Use memoization to avoid recomputation.

- **Precompute prefix XORs** for O(1) subarray XOR queries.

- This reduces the exponential problem to O(n² × k) with memoization.

- **Trade-off:**  
  - Brute-force is unworkable; DP with memoization is optimal for the constraints.
  - Tabulation or recursion+memo both work.

### Corner cases to consider  
- k == 1 → Partition not needed; XOR of whole array.
- k == n → Each subarray is one element; the max is the largest number.
- All elements equal.
- Large numbers, possible 0's in input.
- nums with length < k (invalid — should not be input as per constraints).

### Solution

```python
def minimumXORSum(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    # Compute prefix XOR for O(1) range XORs
    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] ^ nums[i]
    
    from functools import lru_cache

    # dp(idx, parts): min possible of max XOR splitting nums[idx:] into parts subarrays
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def dp(idx, parts):
        if parts == 1:
            # only one partition: XOR all remaining numbers
            return prefix[n] ^ prefix[idx]
        res = float('inf')
        # Try all possible first-cut positions
        # Want at least one in each subarray; so can go up to n - (parts - 1)
        for j in range(idx + 1, n - (parts - 1) + 1):
            xor = prefix[j] ^ prefix[idx]
            # The maximum in this configuration is max(xor, dp(j, parts - 1))
            val = max(xor, dp(j, parts - 1))
            res = min(res, val)
        return res
    
    return dp(0, k)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n² × k)  
    - For each of O(n × k) subproblems, O(n) transitions possible.
    - n ≤ 200, so feasible.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n × k) for DP cache and O(n) for prefix array.


### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if k is very large, say n (same as each element a subarray)?  
  *Hint: What is the max XOR possible then?*
- Can the approach be optimized for constant-sized k?  
  *Hint: Is precomputing valid for small k?*
- If subarrays don’t need to be contiguous, how would your solution change?  
  *Hint: This is a subset partitioning instead of interval DP problem.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic use case for **interval DP with memoization** (also called "partition DP") where you want to split an array into groups to optimize a worst-case statistic (here: the maximum XOR).  
Patterns used include prefix XOR for O(1) subarray queries, recursion with memoization to avoid redundant computation, and careful attention to partition constraints.  
This DP technique broadly applies to "partition array to minimize/maximize aggregate function" types of problems, such as **Minimize Largest Sum in k Partitions**, Stone Game variants, and others in interval/partitioning DP.
