### Leetcode 3197 (Hard): Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-area-to-cover-all-ones-ii)

### Description  
You are given a binary grid (matrix of 0s and 1s). Your task is to cover all the 1s in the matrix using at most **two rectangles whose sides are parallel to the axes**. Each rectangle must cover a set of cells (they may overlap), and your goal is to find the **minimum total area (sum of both rectangles’ areas)** required to cover all the 1s.

Imagine the rectangles can freely overlap, and you must find where to place (and possibly split) the rectangles so all 1s are "captured" within some rectangle’s area.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
`grid = [[1,0,0],
         [0,1,1],
         [0,1,0]]`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation:*
- Place Rectangle 1: covers (1,1),(1,2),(2,1) (area 6: rows 1-2, cols 1-2: covers [1,1],[1,2],[2,1])
- Place Rectangle 2: covers (0,0) (area 1)
- But best: Use one rectangle to cover all 1s: from (0,0) to (2,2), total area 3×3=9. But using 2 rectangles, you can split to a vertical/horizontal division covering all 1s with total area 6 (3+3).

**Example 2:**  
Input:  
`grid = [[1, 1, 1],
         [1, 0, 1],
         [1, 1, 1]]`  
Output: `9`  
*Explanation:*
- The smallest rectangle covering all 1s is the full grid (area 9). Using 2 rectangles can't reduce area, so answer is 9.

**Example 3:**  
Input:  
`grid = [[1,0,0,1]]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:*
- Two separate 1s, easiest is to cover each with its own 1x1 rectangle. Total area 1+1=2.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force idea:** Try every possible pair of rectangles, check if their union covers all 1s, and keep the minimum sum of areas.
- But enumerating all rectangles is O(n⁴) per rectangle, O(n⁸) for two, extremely inefficient even for small grids.

**Optimizations:**
- The area of a rectangle covering a subset of 1s depends on the min/max row and col among those 1s.
- Using at most 2 rectangles, try to partition the set of 1s into 2 groups, then use the min area rectangle for each group.
- Try all possible vertical splits (choose a column, everything to the left/right becomes a group) and all possible horizontal splits. For each split:
    - Compute min area for each side (bounding box of 1s in that partition).
    - Total area = area(left/top) + area(right/bottom).
    - Handle the case where all 1s are best covered by a single rectangle.
- Since grid size is up to 50x50, for each possible split O(n), computing bounding boxes precomputed by prefix min/max arrays.

**Why this approach?**
- We must minimize max area, and splitting at every row/column is tractable (O(n)), compared to all possible arbitrary rectangle pairs.

### Corner cases to consider  
- No 1s in the grid → answer is 0.
- All 1s in one rectangle → single bounding box is optimal.
- 1s split far apart → two separate small rectangles better than one large.
- Overlapping rectangles (double-coverage is fine per problem).
- Thin single-row/col of 1s.
- Multiple clusters of 1s.

### Solution

```python
def minArea(grid):
    # Get dimensions
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

    # Collect all coordinates with value 1
    points = [(i, j) for i in range(m) for j in range(n) if grid[i][j] == 1]
    if not points:
        return 0

    # Utility: area of bounding box of points
    def bounding_box_area(cells):
        if not cells:
            return 0
        minr = min(i for i, _ in cells)
        maxr = max(i for i, _ in cells)
        minc = min(j for _, j in cells)
        maxc = max(j for _, j in cells)
        return (maxr - minr + 1) * (maxc - minc + 1)

    # Case 1: Use just one rectangle for all 1s
    best = bounding_box_area(points)

    # Case 2: Try splitting rows
    for split_row in range(1, m):
        top = [p for p in points if p[0] < split_row]
        bottom = [p for p in points if p[0] >= split_row]
        if not top or not bottom:
            continue
        area = bounding_box_area(top) + bounding_box_area(bottom)
        best = min(best, area)

    # Case 3: Try splitting columns
    for split_col in range(1, n):
        left = [p for p in points if p[1] < split_col]
        right = [p for p in points if p[1] >= split_col]
        if not left or not right:
            continue
        area = bounding_box_area(left) + bounding_box_area(right)
        best = min(best, area)

    return best
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(m × n), since we scan the grid once, and for each possible row/col split (O(m) or O(n)), getting bounding box area over ≤ m×n points (but can be optimized with prefix arrays).
- **Space Complexity:** O(m × n) for storing all 1s’ coordinates and intermediates.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if up to k rectangles are allowed, not just 2?  
  *Hint: Consider generalizing the split method or apply DP.*

- How would you optimize bounding box calculation for large or dense grids?  
  *Hint: Precompute prefix min/max for faster region queries.*

- How would you minimize total perimeter instead of total area?  
  *Hint: Change bounding box metrics, adjust splitting.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic example of optimizing region covering via rectilinear partitioning, solvable by considering all possible vertical and horizontal splits—efficient due to the grid’s modest size and direct bounding box area calculation. The approach is a common extension of “minimum bounding rectangle” plus greedy/partitioning tricks, useful in grid clustering, image segmentation, and coverage optimization.
