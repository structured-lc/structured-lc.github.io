### Leetcode 2334 (Hard): Subarray With Elements Greater Than Varying Threshold [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-with-elements-greater-than-varying-threshold)

### Description  
Given an integer array **nums** and an integer **threshold**, find **any** subarray of length **k** such that **every** element in the subarray is greater than **threshold / k**. If there is no such subarray, return -1.  
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within the array.  
Return the size (*k*) of any valid such subarray, or -1 if none exist.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,3,4,3,1]`, `threshold = 6`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: The subarray `[3,4,3]` has size 3, and every element is greater than 6/3 = 2.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [6,5,6,5,8]`, `threshold = 7`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: The subarray `` (size 1) has all elements > 7/1 = 7. Other possible outputs are 2, 3, 4, or 5 because there are multiple subarrays that also meet the requirement.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [2,2,2]`, `threshold = 5`  
Output: `-1`  
Explanation: No subarray exists where all elements in the subarray are greater than threshold divided by subarray size.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, I considered the brute-force solution: for every possible subarray size **k** (from 1 up to n), slide a window of size **k** across nums, and check if every element in the window is greater than threshold/k. If so, return **k**.  
However, this gives an O(n²) solution, which is too slow for n up to 10⁵.  
To optimize, I observed that the hardest subarray to satisfy the condition is the one with the minimum value. If the minimum in a subarray of size **k** is greater than threshold/k, then all other elements are also greater.  
This problem becomes: For each index, find the length of the longest subarray where nums[i] is the minimum. This is the **maximum width ramp** pattern, or "nearest smaller to left/right," frequent in monotonic stack problems.  
For each nums[i], determine the largest window where it remains the minimum, compute its length **len**, and check if nums[i] > threshold/len.  
If so, return len immediately. If none found, return -1.  
Monotonic stack allows us to compute left/right boundaries in O(n) time.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty nums array (guaranteed by constraints: not possible).
- All elements are equal.
- Only one element (length 1 array).
- threshold = 0
- threshold and all nums very large (potential integer overflow: safe in Python due to bigints).
- No subarray is valid (all numbers very small; should return -1).
- Multiple subarrays are valid: return size of any one (as per prompt).

### Solution

```python
def validSubarraySize(nums, threshold):
    n = len(nums)
    left = [0] * n  # left[i]: index of first element to left < nums[i], or -1
    right = [n] * n # right[i]: index of first element to right < nums[i], or n
    
    # Monotonic stack for left boundaries
    stack = []
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] >= nums[i]:
            stack.pop()
        left[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1
        stack.append(i)

    # Monotonic stack for right boundaries
    stack = []
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] >= nums[i]:
            stack.pop()
        right[i] = stack[-1] if stack else n
        stack.append(i)

    for i in range(n):
        # length of subarray where nums[i] is minimum
        length = right[i] - left[i] - 1
        if nums[i] > threshold // length:
            return length

    return -1
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n). Both left/right boundary computations and the final for-loop scan are O(n) because each index is processed at most twice (push and pop in stack).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n). We use two arrays of length n (left/right), and a stack of at most n elements.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you return the actual subarray, not just its length?  
  *Hint: Track the indices where the condition is satisfied; store the boundaries.*
  
- How would you solve this for multiple different threshold queries efficiently?  
  *Hint: Precompute intervals; segment trees or offline queries.*

- If you had streaming input, how would you approach?  
  *Hint: Maintain running min or use sliding window structure.*

### Summary
We use a **monotonic stack** (next smaller to left/right) to determine, for each element, the largest subarray for which it’s the minimum. This reduces the problem from brute-force O(n²) to O(n). This pattern arises often in "maximum/minimum in subarray" problems and can be applied to various histogram, sliding window, and range analysis problems.
