### Leetcode 3608 (Medium): Minimum Time for K Connected Components [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-for-k-connected-components)

### Description  
You are given a list of time-labeled connections (edges) that connect nodes in a graph. Each edge has a time when it appears. Initially, all nodes are disconnected. At each time t, an edge appears between two nodes. Your task: for given k, find the **minimum time t** such that the graph splits into exactly k connected components after processing all edges up to t.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,2],[2,3,3]], k = 2`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: After edges with time ≤ 2, we have two components: {0,1,2}, {3}.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,2]], k = 1`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: At time 2, all connected. One component remains.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[2,3,2],[3,4,3]], k = 2`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: At time 3, components: {0,1}, {2,3,4}.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The final state after each time t is a union-find (DSU) graph.
- Sort edges by time.
- For each time t, process all edges with time ≤ t and count components. (Brute-force is slow)
- Binary search on t: For a given candidate time, check if number of components after adding that many edges is k.
- Use DSU structure to efficiently manage component count.
- Use binary search to minimize t.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All nodes disconnected (no edges, k = n)
- k > n (invalid)
- Multiple edges at the same time
- Redundant (parallel) edges
- Duplicate edges

### Solution

```python
def minTimeForKComponents(n, edges, k):
    times = sorted(set(edge[2] for edge in edges))
    edge_dict = {}
    for edge in edges:
        edge_dict.setdefault(edge[2], []).append((edge[0], edge[1]))
    def num_components_up_to(t):
        parent = list(range(n))
        def find(x):
            while parent[x] != x:
                parent[x] = parent[parent[x]]
                x = parent[x]
            return x
        count = n
        for time in sorted([tt for tt in edge_dict if tt <= t]):
            for u,v in edge_dict[time]:
                fu, fv = find(u), find(v)
                if fu != fv:
                    parent[fu] = fv
                    count -= 1
        return count
    lo, hi = 0, max(times)
    ans = -1
    while lo <= hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        comp = num_components_up_to(mid)
        if comp <= k:
            ans = mid
            hi = mid - 1
        else:
            lo = mid + 1
    return ans
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(E × α(n) × log T) where E is number of edges, α(n) is for DSU, T is time value range.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + E) to store parents and edge buckets.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if edges arrive out of order, or in real time?  
  *Hint: Use a streaming DSU approach or event queue.*

- What if you want the smallest t s.t. number of components ≤ k?  
  *Hint: Adjust your binary search and check condition.*

- What if edges have weights or types?  
  *Hint: Add processing rules and track by type.*

### Summary
This problem uses the offline union-find (DSU) and binary search over answer pattern, which shows up in many dynamic connectivity and parameter minimization graph problems.
