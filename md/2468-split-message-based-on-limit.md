### Leetcode 2468 (Hard): Split Message Based on Limit [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-message-based-on-limit)

### Description  
Given a string message and an integer limit, split the message into the minimum number of **parts** so that each part (except possibly the last) has a length exactly equal to limit.  
Each part ends with a suffix of the form `<a/b>`, where a is the 1-based index for the part, and b is the total number of parts.  
The suffix is included in the size limit. After removing all suffixes and concatenating the message parts, you should obtain the original message.  
If this is not possible, return an empty list.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
`message = "short message"`, `limit = 15`  
Output:  
`["short mess<1/2>","age<2/2>"]`  
Explanation:  
First part: "short mess" (10 chars) + "<1/2>" (5 chars) = 15.  
Second part: "age" (3 chars) + "<2/2>" (5 chars) = 8. Both together reconstruct "short message".

**Example 2:**  
Input:  
`message = "hello world"`, `limit = 11`  
Output:  
`["hello<1/2>", " world<2/2>"]`  
Explanation:  
First part: "hello" (5) + "<1/2>" (5) = 10, fits into 11.  
Second part: " world" (6) + "<2/2>" (5) = 11, fits.  
The parts joined (minus suffixes) reconstruct "hello world".

**Example 3:**  
Input:  
`message = "a verylongmessage"`, `limit = 7`  
Output:  
`[]`  
Explanation:  
Even for k=2, the suffix "<1/2>" is 5 characters, leaving 2 chars per part — cannot split the message.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- Brute force: Try all possible values for the total number of parts (k = 1 to len(message)). For each k, compute the suffix length for every part:  
  Suffix = `<a/b>` (a and b can have different digit lengths depending on k). The allowed message text per part = limit - len(suffix).  
  Check if the message can be split into k parts fitting these constraints.  
- Optimization:  
  - The suffix length affects available space for the text part (esp. as k grows, suffix gets longer: e.g., "<10/10>" is longer than "<1/2>").  
  - Use binary search between 1 and len(message) to find the minimal valid k.
  - For each k, sum the available payload size for each part, considering suffix sizes.
  - Once we find the smallest k such that the sum of all available slots ≥ message length, build the answer.
  - If impossible, return an empty list.
- Tradeoffs:  
  - This avoids unnecessary string splitting, and by testing k in order, ensures minimal splits.

### Corner cases to consider  
- message too long and limit too small (impossible no matter k)
- limit too small to even fit minimal suffix (e.g., limit < 5–6 chars)
- single-part message (message fits limit minus suffix)
- last part allowed to be shorter than limit
- k with varying digit lengths (e.g., for k=100, suffix becomes longer)
- message with spaces or edge whitespace

### Solution

```python
def splitMessage(message: str, limit: int) -> list[str]:
    # Helper to calculate the total available payload with k parts
    def calc_total_payload(k: int) -> int:
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            # suffix like "<i/k>"
            suffix = f"<{i}/{k}>"
            available = limit - len(suffix)
            if available < 0:
                return -1  # impossible: suffix doesn't fit
            total += available
        return total

    n = len(message)
    # Try k from 1 up to len(message)
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if calc_total_payload(k) < n:
            continue
        # Construct the result
        res = []
        idx = 0  # tracks position in message
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            suffix = f"<{i}/{k}>"
            avail = limit - len(suffix)
            # pick as much message text as fits in this part
            part = message[idx:idx + avail]
            res.append(part + suffix)
            idx += avail
        # Final check: did we cover the while message?
        message_rebuilt = ''.join(part[:-len(f"<{i+1}/{k}>")] if i != k else part[:-len(suffix)] for i, part in enumerate(res, 1))
        if idx >= n:
            return res
    return []
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²), in the worst case.  
  For each possible k (up to n), we simulate up to k parts. Each part computation for the suffix length and availability is O(1), but total message handling may be O(n) per k.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the answer array and temporary variables.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Can you use binary search instead of linear k search?  
  *Hint: Consider monotonicity in k, and if feasible, use binary search to minimize k.*

- What if suffix format changes?  
  *Hint: Make suffix length calculation flexible or parameterized.*

- Can you do it in a single pass or with less copying?  
  *Hint: Isolate where concatenation/copying can be minimized, or retain indices rather than substrings.*

### Summary
This is a **greedy + simulation** problem: for each possible split (increasing number of parts), see if the available space (given suffix overheads) can encode the message. It blends **string manipulation** and dynamic bounds checking—useful in messaging/buffering-related problems or when reconstructing encoded data. Binary search can further optimize finding the minimal valid split. This pattern is common in “split fit with overhead” contexts (e.g., message chunking, packetization).
