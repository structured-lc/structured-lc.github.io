### Leetcode 1413 (Easy): Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-value-to-get-positive-step-by-step-sum)

### Description

This problem involves finding the minimum positive initial value (`startValue`) needed to ensure that a running sum of elements in an array (`nums`) remains positive at each step. Starting with `startValue`, you iteratively add each element in `nums` to the sum, and the sum should never be less than 1.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: `nums = [-3, 2, -3, 4, 2]`
Output: `5`
*Explanation:*
- For `startValue = 4`, the step-by-step sum goes as follows: 
  - `4 - 3 = 1`
  - `1 + 2 = 3`
  - `3 - 3 = 0` (which is less than 1)
  - Therefore, `startValue` must be adjusted.
- For `startValue = 5`, the sums are: 
  - `5 - 3 = 2`
  - `2 + 2 = 4`
  - `4 - 3 = 1`
  - `1 + 4 = 5`
  - `5 + 2 = 7`
  All sums are greater than or equal to 1.

**Example 2:**
Input: `nums = [1, 2]`
Output: `1`
*Explanation:*
- Since the array elements are positive, the minimum `startValue` is 1.

**Example 3:**
Input: `nums = [1, -2, -3]`
Output: `5`
*Explanation:*
- To ensure all sums are positive: 
  - Start with `startValue`.
  - First step: `startValue + 1`
  - Second step: `startValue + 1 - 2`
  - Third step: `startValue + 1 - 2 - 3`
  - `startValue + 1 - 2 - 3 ≥ 1` implies `startValue ≥ 5`.

### Thought Process

1. **Brute Force Idea:** Iterate over possible values of `startValue` (starting from 1) and check if the running sum stays positive. This approach is inefficient for large numbers.

2. **Optimized Approach:** Instead of trying all values, note that the minimum `startValue` is determined by the smallest sum encountered when adding elements from `nums`. Thus, calculate the running sum for `nums` and find the minimum sum. The minimum `startValue` is then `1 - minSum`, ensuring that even the smallest sum remains positive.

3. **Choosing the Final Approach:** The optimized approach is more efficient because it only requires a single pass through the array, avoiding unnecessary iterations.

### Corner Cases to Consider

- **Empty Array:** The problem assumes `nums` is not empty.
- **One Element Array:** If `nums = [n]`, the minimum `startValue` is `max(1 - n, 1)`.
- **All Positive Elements:** If all elements in `nums` are positive, the minimum `startValue` is 1.

### Solution

```python
def minStartValue(nums):
    """
    Returns the minimum positive value of startValue such that the step-by-step sum is never less than 1.
    
    Args:
        nums (list[int]): The array of integers.
    
    Returns:
        int: The minimum positive startValue.
    """
    # Initialize variables to track the running sum and minimum sum encountered
    running_sum = 0  
    min_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in nums to calculate the running sum and find the minimum sum
    for num in nums:
        running_sum += num  # Update the running sum by adding the current element
        min_sum = min(min_sum, running_sum)  # Update the minimum sum if necessary
    
    # Calculate the minimum startValue needed to ensure all sums are positive
    return 1 - min_sum
```

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`, because we iterate over `nums` once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space to store variables like `running_sum` and `min_sum`, regardless of the size of `nums`.

### Potential Follow-up Questions

Follow-up question 1:  
  *Hint: Modify the problem to consider the maximum sum instead of the minimum sum.*

Follow-up question 2:  
  *Hint: Consider handling negative `startValue` values.*

Follow-up question 3:  
  *Hint: What if `nums` can be modified before calculating the `startValue`?*

### Summary

This problem is solved using a single pass through the array, tracking the minimum sum encountered. It illustrates the pattern of using a single variable to track a minimum or maximum value in a sequence, which is a common approach in algorithmic problems. This technique can be applied to various problems involving sequences and cumulative sums.
