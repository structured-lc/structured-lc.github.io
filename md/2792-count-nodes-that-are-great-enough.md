### Leetcode 2792 (Hard): Count Nodes That Are Great Enough [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-nodes-that-are-great-enough)

### Description  
You're given the root of a binary tree and an integer **k**.  
A node is called **great enough** if:
- The node's subtree contains **at least k nodes** (including itself).
- The node’s value is **greater than the value of at least k nodes** in its subtree.

Return the number of nodes in the tree that are great enough.

**"Subtree"** includes the node itself and all its descendants.  
**"Greater than at least k nodes"**: For node x, there must be at least k nodes in its subtree with value less than x’s value.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `root = [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]`, `k = 2`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:  
- Node 7: subtree = [7,6,5,4,3,2,1] (7 nodes), 7 is greater than 6 nodes (all others), so it counts.
- Node 6: subtree = [6,4,3], 6 > 4,3 (2 nodes), so it counts.
- Node 5: subtree = [5,2,1], 5 > 2,1 (2 nodes), so it counts.
- All others do not meet criteria (either too few in subtree or not enough nodes less than value).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `root = [1]`, `k = 1`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation:  
- Only one node. Its subtree has 1 node, but there are 0 nodes with value less than 1. So, it does not count.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `root = [5,3,8,1,4,null,10]`, `k = 2`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:  
```
      5
     / \
    3   8
   / \   \
  1   4   10
```
- Node 3: subtree=[3,1,4] (3 nodes), 3 > 1 (1), 3 > 4 (0). So only 1 node less, need ≥2, so does not count.
- Node 5: subtree=[5,3,1,4,8,10] (6 nodes), 5 > 3,1,4 (3), so yes.
- Node 8: subtree=[8,10] (2 nodes), 8 > 10 (0), so not enough.
- Node 4: subtree=[4] (1 node), fails min-subtree-size condition.
- Node 1: subtree=[1], fails.
- Node 10: subtree=, fails.
- **So, only nodes 5 and 3 count. (Example can be adjusted depending on tree shape)***

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, let's understand what is required for each node:
- We need to know, for each node, the size of its subtree.
- For each node, how many nodes in its subtree have a value less than its own.

Brute-force approach:
- For each node, collect all values in its subtree (O(n) per node), then count those less than the node’s value and check subtree size.
- But this would be O(n²) for n nodes.

Optimized approach:
- Since subtrees do not overlap, we can do a post-order DFS that, for each node, combines information from the left and right children.
- To efficiently answer "how many nodes in this subtree are less than node.val", we can:
  - If k is small (≤10, per constraints), we can keep the k largest elements in the subtree using a min-heap (or use an array and sort, since k is small).
  - While traversing, for each node, get left and right results, merge them, add current node value, count those less than node.val.

Trade-offs:
- For large k, storing all subtree values would be too slow (O(n) per node).
- Since k is capped (e.g., k ≤ 10), it’s fine to store up to 2k smallest values at each node (for efficient merge).

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty tree (root is None)
- k = 0 (trivial, every node counts, but k ≥ 1 by constraints)
- k > number of nodes in the tree (should always return 0)
- All node values equal (the "greater than at least k nodes" condition fails)
- Only one node (never counts for k ≥ 1)
- Highly unbalanced tree (should not affect correctness)

### Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def countGreatEnoughNodes(root, k):
    # Helper function to traverse and return sorted subtree values (cap to 2k for efficiency).
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            # No nodes, empty subtree
            return [], 0, 0  # values list, subtree size, result count
        
        left_vals, left_size, left_res = dfs(node.left)
        right_vals, right_size, right_res = dfs(node.right)
        
        # Merge left and right values, plus own value, keeping only up to 2*k smallest
        merged = left_vals + right_vals
        merged.append(node.val)
        merged.sort()
        if len(merged) > 2 * k:
            merged = merged[:2*k]
        
        size = left_size + right_size + 1
        
        # Count number of nodes in merged less than current node's value (linear scan)
        cnt_less = 0
        for v in merged:
            if v < node.val:
                cnt_less += 1
            else:
                break

        is_great_enough = (size >= k) and (cnt_less >= k)
        
        res = left_res + right_res + (1 if is_great_enough else 0)
        return merged, size, res
    
    _, _, result = dfs(root)
    return result
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n × k × log k)  
  For each of n nodes, merging two sorted lists of up to 2k elements and sorting/merging them is acceptable since k is small (≤10). For each node, we perform O(k log k) work.

- **Space Complexity:** O(h × k),  
  where h = tree height. At each recursive call, we store up to 2k values, and recursion stack goes up to h.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would your solution change if k could be as large as n?
  *Hint: Can you avoid storing all node values? Is there a more efficient way for counting?*

- Could you solve the problem if "greater than at least k nodes" was replaced by "greater than or equal to at least k nodes"?
  *Hint: How does equality affect your counting mechanism?*

- What if the tree was immutable and you had to answer many such queries for different k?
  *Hint: Consider preprocessing or efficient per-query strategies.*

### Summary
This problem uses the "post-order DFS with subtree aggregation" pattern, taking advantage of k's small limit to efficiently merge and process small collections of subtree values.  
It's a classic example of handling subtree statistics using bottom-up traversal and can be adapted for problems like "k-th largest in subtree", "number of nodes ≤ x in subtree", etc. The pattern is widely applicable when subtree queries need to be answered per node.


### Flashcard
Use post-order DFS to compute subtree sizes and count nodes with values less than the current node, checking the "great enough" condition for each.
