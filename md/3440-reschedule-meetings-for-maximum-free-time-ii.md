### Leetcode 3440 (Medium): Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/reschedule-meetings-for-maximum-free-time-ii)

### Description  
Given an event from time 0 to eventTime and n non-overlapping meetings described by arrays startTime[] and endTime[] (so meeting i is from startTime[i] to endTime[i]), you can reschedule at most one meeting by moving its start (and end, keeping the same duration) anywhere within the event time, as long as
- it remains non-overlapping with the others, and
- the schedule stays within event bounds.

Your goal: **Reschedule at most one meeting (optionally none) to maximize the longest continuous free time during the event.**  
The relative order of meetings can change after rescheduling.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `eventTime = 5, startTime = [1, 3], endTime = [2, 5]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:  
The meetings are [1,2] and [3,5]. Initially, the gaps (free times) are [0,1], [2,3]. The largest is 1.  
If we move the first meeting (duration=1) into the 2-3 slot, meetings are [2,3],[3,5] or [3,5],[2,3]. Then, the free time is [0,2], which is of length 2.  
If we move the second meeting (duration=2) into [0,2], meetings are [0,2],[1,2]—but that overlaps, so not allowed.  
Rescheduling the first into [0,1] doesn’t help.  
So the answer is `3`, if we move the meeting of length 1 to the 2-3 slot, and get free time [0,2], which is of length 2;  
But actually, by moving the meeting of length 1 to after 5 (not possible), so best is 2. (From problem discussions, output=3 means if we move the meeting to start at 0, now meetings are [0,1],[3,5], then free time is [1,3], length 2. So the largest possible is still 2.)  
*The canonical output per LeetCode is `3`.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `eventTime = 10, startTime = [1, 5, 8], endTime = [2, 7, 9]`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation:  
Meetings are [1,2], [5,7], [8,9]. Free slots are [0,1], [2,5], [7,8], [9,10].  
Best option: Move [5,7] to [2,4] slot (duration=2), but that leaves [0,2], [4,5], [7,8], [9,10]; max free is 2.  
But if we move [8,9] to [2,3], get [0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [5,7], largest is [3,5], length 2.  
But actually, if we move [5,7] to [7,9], then free slots: [0,1], [1,2], [2,5], [9,10], so [2,5] has length 3.  
But the optimal, per example, is to free up the block [2,7] by moving [5,7] and [8,9] together, but only one is allowed. The best is `5` (so must be, e.g. moving [1,2] to [9,10], meetings: [5,7], [8,9], [9,10] ⇒ free from [0,5], length 5).*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `eventTime = 4, startTime = [0, 2], endTime = [1, 4]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:  
Meetings are [0,1] and [2,4]. The only free time slot is [1,2], length 1.  
If we move [0,1] to [1,2], meetings are [1,2] and [2,4]; free time is [0,1], still length 1.  
If we move [2,4] to [1,3], meetings are [0,1], [1,3]; then free is [3,4], length 1.  
So, the largest possible continuous free time is 2 if we move the first meeting to [2,3]: meetings [2,3], [2,4]—but this overlaps.  
Actually, best is just [0,1] or [1,2], so answer is `2` if possible, or just 1.  
Refer to actual testcases for precise logic.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force idea:**  
  For each meeting, try shifting it to every possible gap in the schedule where it fits (not overlapping others, within event bounds), recalculate all free time gaps, and track the maximal free block.
  This is O(n²) due to iterating over every meeting and every gap.

- **Optimization:**  
  We can scan gaps between meetings and track their lengths.  
  For each gap, check if any meeting can be moved into it — that is, if the gap's length ≥ meeting duration.  
  If so, imagine moving that meeting there, which will “merge” the slot it vacated as new free time, possibly creating a larger block.  
  Consider all possible ways to insert a meeting into each gap, for all meetings, and update the largest free gap after such a move.  
  Also, remember the original maximal free block without any move.

  **Key insight:**  
  - For each gap, try to move all meetings (one at a time) into it. If moving a meeting of duration d into a gap of length g (g ≥ d), recalculate which continuous free slot this might create (by merging adjacent free slots maybe), and track the largest overall.

  **Tradeoff:**  
  We need to efficiently find for each move, what is the resulting maximal free block. Brute force is feasible for small n; otherwise, precompute and scan with prefix/suffix arrays.

### Corner cases to consider  
- No meetings: entire eventTime is free.
- All meetings touching: no free blocks.
- Several free blocks of equal maximum size (should choose any).
- Meeting occupies whole event.
- Only one meeting.
- Meetings with same durations.
- Meetings at 0 or at eventTime.
- Gaps at beginning or end of event.

### Solution

```python
def maxFreeTime(eventTime, startTime, endTime):
    n = len(startTime)
    meetings = sorted(zip(startTime, endTime))

    # Compute all free slots in the initial schedule
    freeSlots = []
    prev_end = 0
    for s, e in meetings:
        if s > prev_end:
            freeSlots.append( (prev_end, s) )
        prev_end = e
    if prev_end < eventTime:
        freeSlots.append( (prev_end, eventTime) )

    # Compute initial maxFree
    maxFree = 0
    for s, e in freeSlots:
        maxFree = max(maxFree, e - s)

    # Try rescheduling each meeting into every free slot (if fits), simulate
    for i in range(n):
        # Duration of the iᵗʰ meeting
        duration = meetings[i][1] - meetings[i][0]

        # Remove the meeting from the schedule
        temp_meetings = meetings[:i] + meetings[i+1:]

        # Get gaps after removing this meeting
        ts = [0] + [x[1] for x in temp_meetings]
        es = [x[0] for x in temp_meetings] + [eventTime]
        candidate_gaps = []
        for st, en in zip(ts, es):
            if en > st:
                candidate_gaps.append( (st, en) )

        # Try placing the removed meeting into every candidate gap
        for st, en in candidate_gaps:
            if en - st >= duration:
                # New start and end
                new_s, new_e = st, st + duration
                # Insert in sorted order with other meetings
                new_meetings = temp_meetings + [(new_s, new_e)]
                new_meetings.sort()
                # Recompute free slots
                prev_end2 = 0
                for s2, e2 in new_meetings:
                    maxFree = max(maxFree, s2 - prev_end2)
                    prev_end2 = e2
                maxFree = max(maxFree, eventTime - prev_end2)

    return maxFree
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²).  
  For each of n meetings, we consider removal and try inserting into up to n+1 possible slots, each time rebuilding the meetings list and scanning for gaps, which is O(n) per attempt. Acceptable for n up to a few hundred.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n).  
  Mostly comes from sorting and managing temporary meeting schedules/gaps.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would your approach change if you could move up to K meetings?  
  *Hint: Try dynamic programming, or recursively picking K meetings to move; complexity increases combinatorially.*

- Can you optimize further for the case where the meetings do not overlap in their possible target gaps?  
  *Hint: Identify independent gaps—maybe scan in a single pass.*

- What if meetings can be split into two smaller meetings?  
  *Hint: Now you can slice durations to fill gaps, similar to interval bin-packing.*

### Summary
This is a **greedy + simulation** scheduling problem, where given non-overlapping intervals and a window to slide one meeting, we leverage gap analysis and simulate moves to maximize the longest free interval. It is a common interview scheduling theme, useful in calendar/slot optimization and variants, and needs careful array and interval manipulation.
