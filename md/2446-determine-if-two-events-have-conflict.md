### Leetcode 2446 (Easy): Determine if Two Events Have Conflict [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-events-have-conflict)

### Description  
Given two events, each represented as a list of two strings in "HH:MM" 24-hour format (`[startTime, endTime]`), determine if the two events **overlap** on the same day. Events are *inclusive* at both start and end; that is, if `event1` ends at exactly the same time as `event2` starts, they are considered to be in conflict. Return `True` if the events have any overlap, else `False`.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `event1 = ["01:15", "02:00"]`, `event2 = ["02:00", "03:00"]`  
Output: `True`  
*Explanation: Both events include 02:00, so they overlap at exactly that time.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `event1 = ["01:00", "02:00"]`, `event2 = ["01:20", "03:00"]`  
Output: `True`  
*Explanation: `event2` starts before `event1` ends, so there is overlap between 01:20 and 02:00.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `event1 = ["10:00", "11:00"]`, `event2 = ["14:00", "15:00"]`  
Output: `False`  
*Explanation: The events are at completely different times with a gap between them, so they do not conflict.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
To solve this, I first clarify what it means for two events to conflict: they conflict if their time ranges intersect—i.e., they share at least one minute in common. Since the times are inclusive, if the end of one event is equal to the start of the other, that's still a conflict.

A brute-force way would be to expand times to a per-minute level, but that's unnecessary and inefficient.

Instead, I can check:
- Do the event ranges overlap?
- This happens **unless** one event ends strictly before the other starts.

So, the events conflict unless:
- `event1` ends < `event2` starts, or
- `event2` ends < `event1` starts.

But since the intervals are inclusive, we use ≤ (not <) for overlap:
- Overlap exists **iff** `event1.start` ≤ `event2.end` and `event2.start` ≤ `event1.end`.

Given time is in string format but as "HH:MM", string comparison works (since e.g., "09:00" < "11:02"). This allows direct compare without parsing.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Events that touch at a single minute: e.g., `["10:00", "11:00"]` vs. `["11:00", "12:00"]` (should return `True`)
- One event fully envelops the other: e.g., `["10:00", "15:00"]` vs. `["11:00", "12:00"]`
- Events are identical
- Both events are a single minute: e.g., `["10:00", "10:00"]` vs. `["10:00", "10:00"]`
- No overlap at all: times are entirely before or after
- Times at midnight: e.g., `["00:00", "01:00"]` vs. `["01:00", "02:00"]`

### Solution

```python
def haveConflict(event1, event2):
    # Each event is ["start", "end"] time in "HH:MM" 24-hour format

    # Compare ranges (inclusive)
    # They conflict if event1 starts ≤ event2 ends AND event2 starts ≤ event1 ends
    start1, end1 = event1
    start2, end2 = event2

    # String comparison works for "HH:MM" format
    return start1 <= end2 and start2 <= end1
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(1)  
  Just comparing four strings: no matter the input values, only constant-time comparison is done.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  Only fixed local variables; no extra space usage beyond the input.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the events are given in different time formats, or might span midnight?  
  *Hint: Consider parsing string times into minutes since midnight for easier comparison.*

- How would you generalize the solution to a list of many events and return all pairs with a conflict?  
  *Hint: Sort by start time. Sweep line or nested loops for overlap detection.*

- If the time intervals are not inclusive, what condition would you change?  
  *Hint: Adjust the comparison to use < or > rather than ≤.*

### Summary
This problem is a **classic interval overlap detection**, leveraging the fact that "HH:MM" format can be compared directly as strings. The solution is a one-liner after understanding the overlap rule—widely applicable to schedule conflicts, event calendars, or any scenario needing two interval checks. The “check if intervals overlap” pattern is commonly seen in calendar problems, reservation systems, and scheduling algorithms.
