### Leetcode 2830 (Medium): Maximize the Profit as the Salesman [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-profit-as-the-salesman)

### Description  
Given `n` houses in a row (indexed 0 to n-1), and a list of offers. Each offer is `[start, end, gold]` meaning the buyer wants *all* houses in range `[start, end]` (inclusive) and pays `gold`. You want to select a subset of non-overlapping offers (no house is sold more than once) to maximize total gold. Some houses may remain unsold.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 5, offers = [[0,0,4],[0,2,5],[1,4,3],[3,4,6]]`  
Output: `9`  
*Explanation: Take offers [0,2,5] and [3,4,6]. Total: 5 + 6 = 11, but they overlap at house 3.  
The optimal is [0,0,4] + [3,4,6] = 4 + 6 = **10**.  
But with [0,2,5] + [3,4,6] (5+6=11), but these overlap at house 3.  
Should be [0,2,5] + [3,4,6] is invalid, because [0,2,5] is for 0-2, [3,4,6] is 3-4, so that's valid. 5+6=11.*

So, **Output: 11**.  
*Explanation: Take offers [0,2,5] and [3,4,6], they do not overlap. Total = 5 + 6 = 11.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 4, offers = [[0,0,8],[1,2,4],[0,2,7],[2,3,5]]`  
Output: `13`  
*Explanation: Take [0,0,8] and [2,3,5]. 8 + 5 = 13.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 3, offers = [[0,2,3],[1,1,1],[0,0,2]]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Only [0,2,3] is possible (covers all houses). Other combos overlap.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The naive brute-force is to try all subsets of offers, only accepting those with disjoint house ranges. This is exponential and infeasible.
- Notice: This is like the classic "Weighted Interval Scheduling" problem.
- Sort offers by end time.  
- For each offer, find the last offer ending before this one starts (for non-overlapping) – combine their profits.
- Use dynamic programming:
  - `dp[i]` = maximal profit considering offers up to iᵗʰ offer.
  - For offer i:  
      - Either take it: `dp[latestNonOverlapping] + offer[i].gold`
      - Or skip it: `dp[i-1]`
  - Use binary search to find latest non-overlapping offer efficiently.
- Final answer: dp[lastOffer]

**Why this approach:**
- Time efficient (O(m log m) where m = #offers) because of binary search and DP.
- Well-known design, proven correctness.

### Corner cases to consider  
- No offers → profit is 0.
- All offers overlap (must pick the one with the highest gold).
- Houses not all covered (some may remain unsold).
- Offers that cover same range—pick the most valuable.
- Offers with end < start (invalid, should not happen).
- Large n but few offers.

### Solution

```python
from bisect import bisect_right

def maximizeTheProfit(n, offers):
    # Sort offers by their end index
    offers.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    m = len(offers)
    # dp[i]: max gold considering the first i offers
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    # For binary search, keep an array of offer ends
    ends = [offers[i][1] for i in range(m)]
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        start, end, gold = offers[i-1]
        # Find rightmost offer with end < start using bisect_right
        j = bisect_right(ends, start - 1)
        # Option 1: take this offer, add to dp[j]
        take = dp[j] + gold
        # Option 2: skip it, inherit dp[i-1]
        skip = dp[i-1]
        dp[i] = max(take, skip)
        
    return dp[m]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(m log m), where m = number of offers. Sorting offers is O(m log m), and each offer is processed with binary search O(log m).
- **Space Complexity:** O(m) for the dp and ends arrays (extra storage per offer).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the gold paid is proportional to the number of houses in the offer?  
  *Hint: Each offer would be `[start, end]` (fixed rate), adjust DP—problem remains similar.*

- How would you handle updates/queries online (dynamic insertion/deletions of offers)?  
  *Hint: You might need an interval/tree structure (e.g., segment tree, interval tree).*

- Can you recover the actual list of offers chosen?  
  *Hint: Track parents in DP, then reconstruct path at end.*

### Summary
This is a textbook "Weighted Interval Scheduling" DP with profits, used when picking a subset of non-overlapping intervals for maximum value. The core idea combines sorting, DP, and binary search, and this pattern shows up in resource allocation, scheduling, and interval-packing problems. If you see "select non-overlapping offers for max value," think of this greedy + DP combo!
