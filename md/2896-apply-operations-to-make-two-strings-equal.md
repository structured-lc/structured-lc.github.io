### Leetcode 2896 (Medium): Apply Operations to Make Two Strings Equal [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-make-two-strings-equal)

### Description  
Given two binary strings **s1** and **s2** of equal length and an integer **x**, you are allowed to perform the following operations any number of times to transform s1 into s2:

- Flip the bits at any two chosen indices *i* and *j* (i ≠ j) in s1. The cost of this operation is x.
- Flip the bits at consecutive indices *i* and *i+1* (0 ≤ i < n-1) in s1. The cost of this operation is 1.

Return the **minimum cost** to make s1 equal to s2. If it is impossible, return -1.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s1 = "1100", s2 = "1001", x = 2`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: The differences are at indices 1 and 3. We can use the (i, j) operation for (1, 3) with cost 2.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s1 = "110", s2 = "101", x = 2`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: The only difference is at index 1 and 2. Apply the adjacent swap (1, 2) with cost 1.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s1 = "10101", s2 = "01010", x = 100`  
Output: `250`  
*Explanation: Every character is different. There are 5 differences (odd), so it's impossible. Output is -1.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

First, compare s1 and s2, noting indices where the bits differ.

Observation:
- Each operation inverts exactly two bits. Therefore, the total number of different bits must be even, else it is impossible.
- Try to pair up the differences in a way that minimizes cost.

Brute-force idea:
- Try all pairings of differing bits, picking either adjacent swap (cost 1) or arbitrary swap (cost x) for each.

Optimized approach:
- Greedily consider pairs of consecutive differing bits: if two differences are adjacent, it's usually cheaper to fix them with the consecutive swap (cost 1), unless x < 2.
- For non-adjacent pairs, pairing them via the arbitrary operation costs x.
- Use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimal cost to resolve up to each index.
- Iterate over the positions of differing bits and decide at each step whether to pair the current bit with the next (if adjacent, using cost 1) or with further away (using cost x).

Final approach:
- Get all indices where s1 and s2 differ.
- If there are an odd number of differences, return -1.
- For each adjacent pair of differing bits, if they are next to each other, compare cost 2 (two single swaps) vs cost x (arbitrary swap) vs cost 1 (adjacent swap).
- Use dynamic programming to minimize the total cost as we process the diffs list.

### Corner cases to consider  
- s1 and s2 are already equal: cost is 0.
- Odd number of differing bits: impossible, output -1.
- All differences are in adjacent pairs: consecutive swap might be optimal.
- Very high or very low x relative to n.
- Input strings are of length 1.
- Multiple pairs of adjacent differences.

### Solution

```python
def minOperations(s1: str, s2: str, x: int) -> int:
    # Record indices where bits differ
    diff = []
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            diff.append(i)
    
    # Odd number of differences - impossible
    if len(diff) % 2 == 1:
        return -1

    n = len(diff)
    if n == 0:
        return 0  # already equal

    # dp[i]: min cost to fix all differences from position i onwards
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    # Fill backwards
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        # Option 1: Pair diff[i] and diff[i+1]
        # If they are adjacent, cost is min(2\*x, 1)
        if diff[i+1] == diff[i] + 1:
            cost_pair = min(2 * x, 1)
        else:
            cost_pair = x

        dp[i] = cost_pair + dp[i + 2] if i + 2 <= n else float('inf')
        
        # Option 2: (single flips) Not allowed, as only flips of two bits allowed

    # The dp only considers pairing in order; 
    # since only two operations, and greedy match works due to costs,
    # the above is sufficient.
    return dp[0]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of s1/s2. We scan the strings to collect the differing positions and do a linear DP over the (at most) n positions.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the list of differing indices and the DP array.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if flip operations could be performed on more than two bits at once?  
  *Hint: Consider generalizing DP and matching concepts.*

- Could you solve this in constant space?  
  *Hint: Think about greedy matching and overlapping pairs.*

- If the operation cost for adjacent flips varied per index, how would you change your approach?  
  *Hint: The DP must account for variable costs per pair.*

### Summary
This problem demonstrates a **greedy pairing** and **dynamic programming** pattern, useful for minimizing the cost of repairing mismatches when operations have fixed or variable costs. It is closely related to "minimum number of swaps" and "pairing mismatches," and similar patterns can be found in adjacent swaps problems, parity flip corrections, and segment grouping optimization.
