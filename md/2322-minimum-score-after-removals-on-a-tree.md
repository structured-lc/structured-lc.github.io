### Leetcode 2322 (Hard): Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-after-removals-on-a-tree)

### Description  
Given a connected undirected tree with `n` nodes (labeled `0` to `n-1`), each node has an integer value stored in array `nums`. You are also given a list of `n-1` edges (each edge connects two nodes).  
Your task: **Remove exactly two distinct edges, splitting the tree into three connected components**. For each component, take the XOR of all node values in it. The score is the difference between the largest and smallest of these three XOR values.  
Return the **minimum possible score** across all possible pairs of distinct edge removals.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
nums = `[1,5,5,4,11]`,  
edges = `[[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4]]`  
Output: `9`  
*Explanation:  
- Remove edges [0,2] and [2,4]  
- The resulting components:  
    - Component 1: [0,1,3] with nodes 0,1,3 → XOR = 1⊕5⊕4 = 0  
    - Component 2: [2] with node 2 → XOR = 5  
    - Component 3: [4] with node 4 → XOR = 11  
- The XOR values are [0,5,11], the score is 11 - 0 = 11  
- The optimal pair actually gives a lower score (noted as 9 in output), but this shows the computation idea.  
*(In an actual test, show the precise steps for the minimum pair.)*

**Example 2:**  
Input:  
nums = `[3,6,8,2]`,  
edges = `[[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]]`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation:  
- Remove edges [1,2] and [1,3]  
- Components:  
    - [0,1]: 3⊕6 = 5  
    - [2]: 8  
    - [3]: 2  
- XOR values: [5,8,2], score = 8 - 2 = 6*  

**Example 3:**  
Input:  
nums = `[7,2,7]`,  
edges = `[[0,1],[1,2]]`  
Output: `7`  
*Explanation:  
Remove [0,1] and [1,2], get , [1], [2] — XORs are 7,2,7, so score is 7 - 2 = 5. (But optimal is actually 7, matching the output — run all pairs and pick the min.)*


### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
We need to **remove two edges** to split the tree into three components, then minimize the score defined as (max XOR - min XOR) across all such splits.

- **Brute-force approach**: Try all pairs of edges (at most (n-1)\*(n-2)/2), for each pair remove them, find connected components, calculate XOR for each, then score.  
    - Finding connected components and their XORs naively is O(n), and there are O(n²) edge pairs — very slow for large n.

- **How to optimize?**  
    - Note that cutting an edge in a tree always splits it into two parts: a subtree and the "rest."  
    - Observe that for each possible edge, we can preprocess the XOR of all subtrees using a DFS; then for any edge cut, we know the XORs on both sides.
    - For two cuts:
        - If the two edges are in separate subtrees, both cuts are independent.
        - If one cut is in the subtree of the other, their components overlap — handle this carefully.

- **Plan:**
    - For each node, compute the **subtree XOR** rooted at that node (via DFS).
    - For each pair of edges, determine (using parent/child relationships) what the component XORs will be after both cuts.
    - For all O(n²) pairs, compute the three resulting component XORs, keep track of the minimum score found.

- **Trade-offs**:  
    - O(n²) pairs overall; but each pair's calculation is O(1) due to preprocessing.  
    - Space is O(n) for subtree parent/child and XORs.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Very small trees: only 3 nodes  
- Trees that are chains (degenerate)  
- All node values are equal  
- Tree is highly unbalanced  
- Edge removals create tiny/single-node components  
- XORs can be zero (if duplicate values, or even-numbered entries)

### Solution

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def minimumScore(nums, edges):
    n = len(nums)
    # Build adjacency list for tree
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    
    parent = [None] * n
    subtree_xor = [0] * n
    # DFS to compute parent and subtree XORs
    def dfs(node, par):
        parent[node] = par
        xor_sum = nums[node]
        for nei in tree[node]:
            if nei != par:
                xor_sum ^= dfs(nei, node)
        subtree_xor[node] = xor_sum
        return xor_sum
    
    total_xor = dfs(0, -1)
    min_score = float('inf')
    # Store entry and exit time for each node for ancestor-descendant checks
    time = 0
    entry = [0] * n
    exit = [0] * n
    def dfs_time(node, par):
        nonlocal time
        entry[node] = time
        time += 1
        for nei in tree[node]:
            if nei != par:
                dfs_time(nei, node)
        exit[node] = time
        time += 1
    dfs_time(0, -1)
    
    def is_ancestor(u, v):
        # is u ancestor of v?
        return entry[u] <= entry[v] and exit[v] <= exit[u]
    
    # For each pair of non-root nodes u, v (simulate edge removals between parent[u]-u and parent[v]-v)
    nodes = [i for i in range(1, n)]
    for i in range(len(nodes)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nodes)):
            u = nodes[i]
            v = nodes[j]
            
            # Categorize overlap relationship for the cuts
            if is_ancestor(u, v):
                # v is in the subtree of u
                part1 = subtree_xor[v]
                part2 = subtree_xor[u] ^ subtree_xor[v]
                part3 = total_xor ^ subtree_xor[u]
            elif is_ancestor(v, u):
                # u is in the subtree of v
                part1 = subtree_xor[u]
                part2 = subtree_xor[v] ^ subtree_xor[u]
                part3 = total_xor ^ subtree_xor[v]
            else:
                # subtrees are separate
                part1 = subtree_xor[u]
                part2 = subtree_xor[v]
                part3 = total_xor ^ subtree_xor[u] ^ subtree_xor[v]
            vals = [part1, part2, part3]
            min_score = min(min_score, max(vals) - min(vals))
    return min_score
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
    - There are about n²/2 pairs of edge removals (since for each non-root node, simulate one cut for each possible other).
    - Each pair takes O(1) time to compute the resulting split XORs thanks to preprocessing with DFS.
    - Preprocessing is O(n).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
    - Storing adjacency, parents, subtree XOR, and entry/exit time arrays.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If the tree is very large, can you make the solution subquadratic?
  *Hint: Is there a clever way to prune redundant pairs, perhaps based on XOR properties?*

- What if you needed the actual edges to remove, and not just the minimum score?
  *Hint: Keep track of the pair with the minimum score during computation, and output (u, v).*

- Can you extend this to removing more than two edges for more components?
  *Hint: The combination and overlap logic generalizes, but time complexity grows heavily.*

### Summary
This problem uses **tree dynamic programming and ancestor-descendant relationships** to efficiently simulate removing two edges and partitioning the tree. The core trick is to use a single DFS to preprocess the XOR of all subtrees, then in O(1) time for any pair of edge removals, use entry/exit time to determine overlap, and compute XORs for each component.  
The coding pattern is a classic **tree DP + interval/ancestor queries**, which is also useful in many cut/partition problems on trees and graphs.
