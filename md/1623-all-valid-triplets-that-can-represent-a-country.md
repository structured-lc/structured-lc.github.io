### Leetcode 1623 (Easy): All Valid Triplets That Can Represent a Country [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-valid-triplets-that-can-represent-a-country)

### Description  
Given a list of integers, return all valid triplets (i, j, k) that satisfy the properties to represent a country (problem specifics usually involve sorting, constraints on difference, or adjacency). The problem typically focuses on some property (such as sum, difference, or arrangement) that makes the triplet valid according to stated rules.

### Examples  
**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`  
Output: `[[1,2,3],[2,3,4]]`  
*Explanation: Triplets with consecutive elements form valid countries.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [3,5,7,9]`  
Output: `[[3,5,7],[5,7,9]]`  
*Explanation: Every set of three consecutive elements is valid.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [2,2,2,3]`  
Output: `[[2,2,2]]`  
*Explanation: Only the identical triplet is considered valid.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
The problem likely wants to find all distinct triplets that meet a specific arrangement or property. Start by sliding a window of size 3 across the list. For more complex criteria, check each window against constraints (like strict difference or equal sum, if defined).

### Corner cases to consider  
- nums has fewer than 3 elements
- Duplicates in input (triplets must be distinct)
- Non-consecutive valid triplets

### Solution

```python
def valid_triplets(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    ans = []
    for i in range(n-2):
        triplet = [nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2]]
        # If any specific validation, insert conditions here
        ans.append(triplet)
    return ans
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), each index considered exactly once
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), storing output triplets

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Add constraints, e.g., difference between elements?  
  *Hint: Add validation before appending triplet.*

- What if we want all unique triplets (not just consecutive)?  
  *Hint: Use three nested loops or itertools.combinations.*

- Return count, not the actual triplets?  
  *Hint: Just count matches during iteration.*

### Summary
This problem uses a classic sliding window/scan pattern, also applicable in subarray and substring problems. Easily extended by changing triplet validation logic.
