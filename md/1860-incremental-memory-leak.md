### Leetcode 1860 (Medium): Incremental Memory Leak [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/incremental-memory-leak)

### Description  
You are given two integers `memory1` and `memory2` representing the number of bits available in two memory sticks. Every second, starting from 1, you allocate `i` bits of memory to the stick with more available memory. If both have the same, use the first stick. Stop when neither stick can allocate the required `i` bits any longer. Return a list `[lastSecond, memory1Left, memory2Left]` where `lastSecond` is the (1-based) time the allocation failed, and the remaining bits on each stick.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `memory1 = 2, memory2 = 2`  
Output: `[3, 1, 0]`  
*Explanation: Step 1: Give 1 bit to memory1 (now [1,2]), step 2: Give 2 bits to memory2 (now [1,0]), step 3: Need 3 bits but both memory sticks have less. So, stopped at sec 3, left=[1,0].*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `memory1 = 8, memory2 = 11`  
Output: `[6, 0, 4]`  
*Explanation:  
1: Give memory2 1 (8,10)  
2: Give memory2 2 (8,8)  
3: Give memory1 3 (5,8)  
4: Give memory2 4 (5,4)  
5: Give memory1 5 (0,4)  
6: Need 6 but neither stick has ≥6. Return [6,0,4].*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `memory1 = 1, memory2 = 2`  
Output: `[2, 0, 1]`  
*Explanation: First give 1 to memory2 (1,1). Next, 2 to memory1 (would require 2, but memory1 only has 1). Both fail. Stop at step 2.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- This is a **simulation** problem: I simply simulate allocating memory at each second, always giving the required `i` bits to the stick with more left. If both are equal, use the first.
- Brute-force is to use a loop, tracking seconds and deducting from the appropriate stick.
- We don't need any extra data structures—just two variables.
- Stopping condition is the moment neither stick has at least `i` bits for the current time.
- Each step is O(1), and the sum of i increments quadratically, so the number of steps is roughly O(√(memory1+memory2)).
- There aren’t major optimizations possible because we must simulate at least up to the step that overflows.

### Corner cases to consider  
- One or both memory sticks start at 0 (no allocation possible).
- Both are equal in the beginning.
- Large values for memory1/memory2 (test for integer overflow, avoid performance issues).
- The required memory surpasses both available at the same step.
- Memory sticks alternating as the larger value.

### Solution

```python
def memoryLeak(memory1: int, memory2: int) -> list[int]:
    # Start allocation counter
    second = 1
    
    # Continue as long as either stick can receive the required allocation
    while memory1 >= second or memory2 >= second:
        # Decide which stick to allocate to
        if memory1 >= memory2:
            # If memory1 is greater or equal, allocate to memory1
            memory1 -= second
        else:
            # Otherwise allocate to memory2
            memory2 -= second

        # Move to next second
        second += 1

    # Return the time allocation failed and remaining memories
    return [second, memory1, memory2]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(√(memory1 + memory2)). The sum of the allocations is 1 + 2 + ... + k ≈ k²/2, so the number of steps before allocation fails is around √(2 × (memory1 + memory2)). Each allocation is O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). We use only a few integer variables; no extra data structures, regardless of input size.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you wanted to simulate allocation among k (>2) memory sticks?  
  *Hint: Track the largest stick in a list each time; use a priority queue (heap) for efficiency.*

- How would you do this if allocation amount at each second followed a different pattern (e.g., doubles each time)?  
  *Hint: Carefully calculate what is required at each second and compare, or derive a formula for when an overflow would occur.*

- If the memory sticks can be refilled at some points, how would you extend the simulation?  
  *Hint: Add logic to process external refill events and continue allocation as above between refills.*

### Summary
This is a classic **simulation problem**, with simple greedy logic: at each step, allocate to the largest stick. The optimal approach is a straightforward loop. No data structures are required. Almost all similar problems about resource allocation, alternating operations, or distributing load among elements can be approached by similar simulation or greedy strategies.
