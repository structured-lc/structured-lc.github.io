### Leetcode 3323 (Medium): Minimize Connected Groups by Inserting Interval [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-connected-groups-by-inserting-interval)

### Description  
Given a list of intervals where each interval represents `[start, end]`, and an integer `k`, you are allowed to insert **exactly one new interval** whose length is at most `k`. The start and end of this new interval can be any integers such that `end - start ≤ k`.  
Your task is to insert this one interval such that *after insertion*, the **number of connected groups** is minimized.  
A **connected group** is a set of intervals such that any two intervals in the group are directly or indirectly connected (overlap or touch), forming a continuous range without gaps.  
Return the *minimum* number of connected groups after optimally inserting the new interval.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `intervals = [[1, 2], [5, 6], [8, 10]], k = 3`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Insert `[2, 8]`. New intervals: `[[1, 2], [2, 8], [5, 6], [8, 10]]`. All merge into one group.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `intervals = [[1, 3], [10, 11], [15, 17]], k = 3`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Insert `[7, 13]`. After insertion: `[[1, 3], [7, 13], [10, 11], [15, 17]]`. Now first two merge, last stays separate. So 2 groups.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `intervals = [[1, 2], [4, 5]], k = 1`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Insert `[2, 4]`. New intervals: `[[1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 5]]`. All connect, so 1 group.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, I’d note that without inserting, we can compute the number of connected groups by merging all intervals as usual.  
The only operation allowed is to insert a single new interval of length ≤ k.  
Key insight: The best way to minimize groups is by spanning the largest possible gap between *existing* groups, ideally reducing the number of groups as much as possible in one go.

**Brute Force:**  
- Try inserting intervals `new = [x, x + len]` for all possible `len (≤ k)` and all valid `x` covering from start to end.
- For each, merge and count number of groups.

This is inefficient.

**Optimized Approach:**  
- Merge the intervals first to identify the *gaps* between the resulting groups.
- Each gap is a region `[end of previous, start of next]` where intervals do not connect.
- For each possible set of consecutive groups, if a single interval of length ≤ k can bridge them (span contiguous gaps), it can reduce the overall group count.
- For each merged interval, consider trying to bridge to as many further intervals as possible within a distance ≤ k.
- Track the minimal group count possible by bridging as many groups together as allowed by k.

**Trade-off:**  
- Sorting and merging intervals costs O(n log n).
- The main loop with potential binary search over end-gap positions is O(n log n) or O(n), so the approach is efficient for large inputs.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All intervals are already connected (no gaps): optimal solution is "do nothing", return 1.
- No intervals at all (edge): inserting any interval results in 1 group.
- Very large k: you can always connect all groups with a single long interval.
- k = 0: only intervals that touch can be bridged, else no change.
- Overlapping or zero-length intervals in input.
- Duplicate intervals.

### Solution

```python
def minConnectedGroups(intervals, k):
    # Sort intervals by start time
    intervals.sort()
    # Merge intervals as per standard approach
    merged = []
    for start, end in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < start:
            merged.append([start, end])
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], end)

    n = len(merged)
    min_groups = n  # Initial group count, reduced from here

    # For each group, try to bridge as many further groups as possible
    # Within a total gap ≤ k (using one inserted interval)
    for i, (cur_start, cur_end) in enumerate(merged):
        # Try to bridge from position i to position j (j > i), as far as possible
        j = i + 1
        total_gap = 0
        while j < n:
            # Current gap = start of next group - end of previous group
            gap = merged[j][0] - merged[j-1][1]
            total_gap += gap
            if total_gap > k:
                break
            j += 1
        # If we can bridge groups i to (j-1), reduce (j-i-1) groups
        min_groups = min(min_groups, n - (j - i - 1))
    return min_groups
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n). Sorting intervals is O(n log n); merging and traversing each interval is O(n²) in worst case (though with optimizations, it’s O(n) using two pointers or binary search to skip over unnecessary gaps).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the merged intervals; constant extra auxiliary storage.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you could insert multiple intervals instead of just one?  
  *Hint: Consider how many gaps you could optimally span with additional intervals, perhaps greedily choosing the biggest gaps.*

- What if all intervals and the inserted interval must have integer endpoints?  
  *Hint: Need to check possible off-by-one issues—verify the connection logic as intervals are closed intervals.*

- How would you handle very large k, or negative k?  
  *Hint: For very large k, all groups can be bridged; for negative k, no valid interval can be inserted.*

### Summary
This problem is a variant of interval merging, with a one-shot optimization leveraging careful analysis of gaps between merged interval groups.  
The core pattern is **merge intervals, then use two pointers or binary search** to optimally select where to place a connecting interval.  
It’s an example of "greedy interval merging", and the merging/gap-bridging technique also applies to coverage, range/paint problems, and network components.
