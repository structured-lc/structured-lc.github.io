### Leetcode 2969 (Hard): Minimum Number of Coins for Fruits II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-coins-for-fruits-ii)

### Description  
Given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the cost of the iᵗʰ fruit (0-indexed). If you buy the iᵗʰ fruit, you can take the next i fruits for free (i.e., fruits at indices i+1, i+2, ..., i+i), as long as they're within bounds. However, even if you can take a fruit for free, you can choose to pay for it so that you trigger this offer again.  
Find the **minimum total coins** needed to obtain every fruit.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `prices = [3,1,2]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation:  
- Buy fruit 0 for 3 coins, get fruit 1 for free.  
- Buy fruit 1 for 1 coin, get fruit 2 for free.  
- You now have all fruits. (Buying fruit 2 directly is costlier overall.)  
So the minimum is 3 + 1 = **4**.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `prices = [1,10,1,1]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:  
- Buy fruit 0 for 1 coin, get fruit 1 for free.  
- Take fruit 1 for free.  
- Buy fruit 2 for 1 coin, get fruit 3 for free.  
- Take fruit 3 for free.  
Total cost is 1 + 1 = **2**.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `prices = [4,4,4]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation:  
- Buy fruit 0 for 4 coins, get fruit 1 for free.  
- Take fruit 1 for free.  
- Take fruit 2 for free (as part of fruit 1's purchase).  
Total cost is **4**.*


### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute Force idea:**  
  For every fruit, decide whether to buy or skip (if available). After a purchase, skip ahead by how many fruits become free. Try both options recursively for all possibilities, always aiming for minimal total coins.
  
- **Optimization:**  
  Since the same subproblems repeat (same index, same state), use **dynamic programming** (memoization or DP array).  
  Let `dp[i]` represent the minimum coins needed to get all fruits from index `i` onwards.

- For each position `i`:
  - Option 1: **Buy** fruit `i` for `prices[i]`, then skip ahead `i+1` fruits (since next `i` fruits are now free).
  - Option 2: **Skip** fruit `i` (if it’s free), just move to `i+1`.
  - The answer for `dp[i]` is the minimum of these two options.

- **Trade-off:**  
  The DP is efficient since `n` ≤ 10⁵ and each subproblem is processed once.  
  Memoization with recursion is also feasible if you use `lru_cache`.  
  There’s also a monotonic queue optimization, but bottom-up DP is clean and sufficiently fast.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Single fruit: `prices = [x]`
- Very large `prices`
- All prices are the same
- All fruits can be covered by a single purchase
- Input arrays with only one or two fruits
- Skipping ahead beyond array length (boundary checks)
- Opportunities where buying a "free" fruit leads to more overall free fruits

### Solution

```python
def minimumCoins(prices):
    n = len(prices)
    # dp[i]: min coins needed from fruit i onwards
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)  # dp[n] = 0 (no fruits left)
    
    # Fill dp array backwards
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        # Option 1: Buy fruit i, get next i fruits free
        next_idx = min(n, i + i + 1)
        buy = prices[i] + dp[next_idx]
        # Option 2: If reached i for free, just move to next
        skip = dp[i + 1]
        # Take min of both options
        dp[i] = min(buy, skip)
    
    return dp[0]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  Each fruit index from n-1 down to 0 is processed once, constant work per index.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
  DP array of length n+1 is used for lookups.


### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Can you compute the solution in O(1) space?
  *Hint: Since we only depend on next few indices, is a rolling/fixed-size array sufficient?*

- How would you solve it if the free offer applied to the previous i fruits instead?
  *Hint: The dependency direction in the DP would flip—process forwards instead of backwards.*

- What changes if you could select *any* k fruits to get for free after a purchase, not just the next i?
  *Hint: Now it's more global rather than local; might need different state representation or greedy.*


### Summary

In this problem, we use **Dynamic Programming (DP)** to model the two choices at each fruit (buy or skip) and their impacts due to the "buy-one-get-many" offers. The state `dp[i]` captures the minimal coins from fruit i onward, and building backwards efficiently computes the result. This pattern applies to other problems with index-dependent skipping, buy-and-get-free, and segment DP decisions.
