### Leetcode 3613 (Medium): Minimize Maximum Component Cost [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-component-cost)

### Description  
Given an undirected graph with **n nodes** and a list of **edges**, each edge has a cost. Partition the nodes into connected components by possibly deleting some edges (any edges can be removed). The **cost** of a component is the largest cost among its internal edges.

Your goal: **Remove edges** so that the **largest component cost** across all components is minimized. Return the **minimum possible value of this maximum cost** after any removals.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[0,2,1]]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Removing edges [0,1,2] and [1,2,3] leaves only [0,2,1]: three components with edge cost 1.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,2],[2,3,3]]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Remove edges [1,2,2] and [2,3,3]; only [0,1,1] remains: all components' max costs ≤ 1.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,2],[2,3,1]]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Remove edge [1,2,2]; now two components, both with max edge cost 1.*


### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The key: min-max partition where each connected component's highest-cost edge is as small as possible.
- If we only keep edges with cost ≤ X, all connected components' cost will be ≤ X.
- We can **binary search** on possible values of X (the cost), and for each X, check if we can delete some edges so all components' max edge cost ≤ X (i.e., only keep edges with cost ≤ X).
- It will always be possible for largest X = max edge cost, and possibly lower for smaller X.
- For each candidate X, build a graph of all edges ≤ X and check if these form a valid partitioning.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Already disconnected graph
- All edges same cost
- No edges at all
- Single node graph


### Solution

```python
def minimize_max_component_cost(n: int, edges: list) -> int:
    # Binary search over cost values
    costs = sorted(set(cost for _,_,cost in edges))
    lo, hi = 0, len(costs)-1
    def can(x):
        # Only use edges ≤ costs[x]; graph may be disconnected
        # No constraints besides the max cost in each component
        return True # always possible; all edges with ≤ current cost
    res = costs[-1]
    while lo <= hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        c = costs[mid]
        # For each connected component, max edge cost ≤ c
        # Keeping only edges with cost ≤ c
        # Is this sufficient? Yes.
        res = c
        hi = mid-1
    return res
# (But actual check is simple: return min of all edge costs)
# Because we can always break all edges, and components with no edges have cost 0
# So true output is just min(e.cost for e in edges)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(E), just take min over edge costs (E = number of edges), or O(E log E) if sorting.
- **Space Complexity:** O(E), for the list of edges/costs.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  
- What if you must keep all nodes connected in a single component?
  *Hint: Minimum Spanning Tree, Kruskal/Prim algorithms.*
- What if some edges are mandatory and cannot be deleted?
  *Hint: Filter out mandatory edges before computation.*
- How would the answer change if each removed edge incurred a penalty?
  *Hint: Modify objective to balance penalty and max component cost.*

### Summary
This is a classic **min-max partition** using binary search or simple selection. For this specific version, the answer reduces to the minimum edge cost because you can always split into many single-edge or singleton-node components.
