### Leetcode 1238 (Medium): Circular Permutation in Binary Representation [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-permutation-in-binary-representation)

### Description  
Given two integers, **n** and **start**, generate a permutation p of the numbers from 0 to 2ⁿ - 1 such that:
- p = start
- Each adjacent pair p[i] and p[i+1] differ by exactly one bit in their binary representation
- The sequence is *circular*: p and p[2ⁿ - 1] must also differ by one bit  

Effectively, construct a **circular Gray code sequence** starting from `start`.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 2, start = 3`  
Output: `[3,2,0,1]`  
Explanation: Binary sequence is (11, 10, 00, 01). Each number differs from the next by one bit.
- 3 (11) → 2 (10) = flip 1st bit
- 2 (10) → 0 (00) = flip 2nd bit
- 0 (00) → 1 (01) = flip 1st bit
- 1 (01) → 3 (11) = flip 2nd bit  
Any circular permutation like `[3,1,0,2]` also works.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 3, start = 2`  
Output: `[2,6,7,5,4,0,1,3]`  
Explanation: Binary sequence is (010, 110, 111, 101, 100, 000, 001, 011).
Each step flips just one bit.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 1, start = 1`  
Output: `[1,0]`  
Explanation: Binary sequence is (1, 0). Only one bit to flip.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute-force idea:**  
  Consider all permutations of the numbers from 0 to 2ⁿ - 1 starting with `start`. For each, check if every consecutive pair (including circular wrap) differs by exactly one bit.  
  - Inefficient: There are (2ⁿ)! permutations. Not feasible for n > 4.

- **Optimized & Recognized Pattern:**  
  This problem is a classic application of **Gray codes**, sequences where each consecutive number differs by only one bit.
  - Standard Gray code for n bits can be generated by: for each i in 0...2ⁿ-1, `i ^ (i >> 1)`
  - To start from `start`, shift the whole Gray code sequence: For each code, output `start ^ code`  
  - This cycle property ensures both the sequence *and* the wrap-around condition (circular) are satisfied[1][2][4].

- **Trade-offs:**  
  - O(2ⁿ) time/space (since we must output the whole sequence)
  - Simple, no recursion/backtracking needed
  - Handles constraints up to n = 16

### Corner cases to consider  
- n = 1 (smallest nontrivial case: answers like [start, start^1])
- start == 0 (Gray code starting at 0)
- start == 2ⁿ-1 (start at the largest number)
- Always verify first and last elements differ by just one bit  
- For any valid output, permutations may differ in order, as long as constraints satisfied

### Solution

```python
def circularPermutation(n, start):
    # Generate 2ⁿ-length Gray code in shifted order starting at 'start'
    result = []
    total = 1 << n  # 2ⁿ

    for i in range(total):
        # Standard Gray code: i ^ (i >> 1), then XOR with start
        gray = i ^ (i >> 1)
        result.append(start ^ gray)

    return result
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(2ⁿ).
  - Need to compute and store all 2ⁿ numbers.
  - Each computation is O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(2ⁿ).
  - Output array holds all 2ⁿ elements; no extra storage required.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you return *all possible* such permutations, not just one?
  *Hint: Think backtracking and visiting unvisited neighbors (perm generation).*
- Can you generate the kᵗʰ element of the sequence in O(1) time, without building the array?
  *Hint: Consider direct computation of Gray code index and shifting.*
- If you wanted the permutation *not* to be circular (no wrap-around), does any Gray code suffice?
  *Hint: Yes; drop the last adjacency requirement.*

### Summary
This solution leverages the **Gray code** generation pattern, a classic bit-manipulation sequence where consecutive numbers differ by one bit. Shifting the code by XOR with `start` rotates the starting position. This approach is efficient and direct whenever the problem requires consecutive *bit-difference-by-1* order, especially for permutations over all binary values. The Gray code trick is broadly useful in combinatorial generation and circuit design.
