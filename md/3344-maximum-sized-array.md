### Leetcode 3344 (Medium): Maximum Sized Array [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sized-array)

### Description  
Given a positive integer s, find the **largest integer n** such that the sum of all elements in the 3D array A of size n × n × n is **≤ s**. Each element in A is defined as A[i][j][k] = i × (j OR k), where 0 ≤ i, j, k < n.  
You are to return the maximum n that keeps the cumulative sum within s.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = 10`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: For n = 2, elements are A[j][k] = 0, A[1][j][k] = 1 × (j OR k). Compute sum: For i=0 → sum is 0. For i=1, (j,k): (0,0)→0, (0,1)→1, (1,0)→1, (1,1)→1. Total sum = 0 + (0+1+1+1) = 3. 3 ≤ 10, so n=2 is valid. But if n=3, sum exceeds 10.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = 0`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Only n = 1 is valid; otherwise, sum would exceed 0.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = 1000`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation: For n = 5, sum is calculated via the formula. Try n=5; the total sum ≤ 1000, but for n=6, the sum surpasses 1000, so output 5.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

First, I notice the 3D array definition: each element is A[i][j][k] = i × (j OR k).
- For all i=0, the value is 0.
- It's symmetric in j and k; we can sum efficiently.

#### Brute-force:
- Simulate: for each 0 ≤ i, j, k < n, sum up i × (j OR k).
- This is O(n³), far too slow for large n.

#### Optimization:
- Precompute the sum for a given n based on mathematical properties.
- Try to express the sum in terms of n.

#### Binary Search:
- Since as n increases, the sum increases monotonically, we can use **binary search** over n from 1 upwards to find the largest valid n such that sum ≤ s.
- For each mid-value of n, compute total sum quickly (either through a direct formula, or optimized code).
- The sum grows polynomially with n, so an upper bound of about 1300 is safe for the search.

I choose binary search since it's efficient and leverages the monotonic growth of the total sum. The formula for sum, or at least an efficient O(n²) method for a given n, makes checking validity fast for each midpoint.

### Corner cases to consider  
- s = 0 (Only n = 1 is valid)
- Very large s (testing against upper search bounds)
- Small s (single digit or even 1)
- n = 1 case (should always be valid since A = 0)
- Potential integer overflow (use int64/bigint)

### Solution

```python
def maxSizedArray(s: int) -> int:
    # The sum increases quickly, so upper bound n=1330 is sufficient
    # Binary search for largest valid n
    
    def get_sum(n: int) -> int:
        # For given n, compute sum of i * (j | k) over all 0 ≤ i, j, k < n
        total = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s2 = 0
            for j in range(n):
                for k in range(n):
                    s2 += (j | k)
            total += i * s2
        return total

    left, right = 1, 1330
    result = 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        total_sum = get_sum(mid)
        if total_sum <= s:
            result = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return result
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** The main driver is the number of iterations (O(log n)) × calculation per test (here O(n²)):
    - Per get_sum(mid): O(n²) (because (j|k) can be precomputed or summed in O(n²))
    - Binary search over n: O(log 1300) iterations (~10)
    - Thus, overall O(n² × log n) -- for n up to ~1300, this is feasible.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space if we don't store the array, just running totals, besides input s.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Can you further optimize the summation formula for i × (j OR k) to get a closed-form, reducing to O(log n) per check?  
  *Hint: Consider combinatorial/grouping properties of (j OR k).*

- How would the solution change if A[i][j][k] = i × (j AND k)?  
  *Hint: The sum behavior differs with bitwise AND, possibly easier to reason about.*

- If you had to solve for huge s (e.g., up to 10¹⁸), how would you avoid integer overflow and optimize computations?  
  *Hint: Use int64 or BigInt, plus math optimizations.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic application of **binary search on the answer** for monotonic constraints, paired with careful sum analysis for custom array generations. The main coding pattern is "Binary Search on n" with an analytical summation for efficient checking. This pattern frequently arises in competitive programming where you must maximize/minimize n for a resource constraint (e.g., "Can build at least n houses given materials X?"). Similar strategies apply in allocation, splitting, or cumulative resource problems.
