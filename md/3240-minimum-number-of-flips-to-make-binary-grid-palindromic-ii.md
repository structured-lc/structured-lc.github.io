### Leetcode 3240 (Medium): Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-flips-to-make-binary-grid-palindromic-ii)

### Description  
Given an m × n binary matrix grid, you can flip any cell (change 0⟷1) any number of times.  
A *row* or *column* is palindromic if it reads the same forwards and backwards.  
Return the **minimum number of flips** needed so that:  
- Every row and column is *palindromic*,
- Total number of 1's in grid is *divisible by 4*.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `grid = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Minimum 3 flips, e.g., flip grid[2], grid[1][1], grid[2] so all rows/columns are palindromes and there are 3 ones, which becomes 4 after flips.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `grid = [[0,1],[0,1],[0,0]]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Minimum 2 flips, e.g., flip grid[1], grid[2][1]:  
grid becomes [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1]], now each row/column is a palindrome and 1's count is 4.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `grid = [[1],[1]]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: You must flip both to 0 (or to 1), to make both a palindrome and count of 1's divisible by 4 (i.e., 0 or 4).*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute-force:**  
  Try all possible ways of flipping cells, check if the result makes rows/columns palindromic and ones count divisible by 4;  
  But with m×n up to 25, that's too many combinations (2²⁵).  
- **Optimization:**  
  Notice every palindromic row and column imposes a *symmetry*:  
    - grid[i][j] and grid[i][n-1-j] (horizontal),  
    - grid[m-1-i][j] (vertical),  
    - And for full symmetry: also grid[m-1-i][n-1-j].  
  So, each *orbit* of cells mapped by these symmetries must have the same value.  
  For each such group, to make them all the same, pick 0 or 1, and pay a cost equal to the number of flips needed.  
  For each group, min(flip to 0, flip to 1).  
  After all groups are assigned, we get a total ones count; if not divisible by 4, we need to try different groupings.  
- **Best approach:**  
  - For every orbit (set of symmetric cells),  
    - For each possible assignment (all become 0 or all become 1),  
    - Sum flip costs, keep track of total 1's.  
  Use recursion (DFS/backtracking) to try both assignments per orbit, and pick overall min where ones % 4 == 0.

### Corner cases to consider  
- 1×1 grid — must handle
- Single row or column (not square grid)
- All zeros or all ones
- Already palindrome but 1's count not divisible by 4
- n or m is odd (center element is its own orbit)
- Multiple ways to achieve minimum; the function should return the minimum.

### Solution

```python
def minFlips(grid):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    orbits = []
    visited = [[False]*n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Identify orbits: Each group is a set of (i, j) with their symmetric partners
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if not visited[i][j]:
                group = set()
                group.add((i, j))
                group.add((i, n-1-j))
                group.add((m-1-i, j))
                group.add((m-1-i, n-1-j))
                
                orbit = set()
                for (x, y) in group:
                    if not visited[x][y]:
                        orbit.add((x, y))
                        visited[x][y] = True
                orbits.append(list(orbit))
    
    min_ans = float('inf')

    def dfs(idx, total_ones, cost):
        nonlocal min_ans
        if idx == len(orbits):
            if total_ones % 4 == 0:
                min_ans = min(min_ans, cost)
            return
        orbit = orbits[idx]
        # Try making this orbit all 0
        cnt1 = sum(grid[i][j] for i, j in orbit)
        flips0 = cnt1
        flips1 = len(orbit) - cnt1
        # Option 1: set all to 0
        dfs(idx+1, total_ones - cnt1, cost + flips0)
        # Option 2: set all to 1
        dfs(idx+1, total_ones - cnt1 + len(orbit), cost + flips1)

    sum1 = sum(cell for row in grid for cell in row)
    dfs(0, sum1, 0)
    return min_ans
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  There are up to ⌊m×n/4⌋ orbits. For each, two decisions (0 or 1);  
  so O(2ˢ), where s = number of orbits ≈ (m×n)//4. For m,n ≤ 5, this is at most 2⁶ = 64 recursive states.  
  Handles the constraint m × n ≤ 25 easily.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(m×n) for orbits and visited matrix, O(m×n) recursion stack depth in worst case.  
  No exponential space.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if 1's divisibility condition is "must be even" instead of mod 4?  
  *Hint: How does that change the depth or assignment logic?*

- How to extend for larger grids (say m×n up to 100)?  
  *Hint: Are there greedy/local-optimization relaxations possible for larger input sizes?*

- How to modify if only rows or only columns must be palindromic?  
  *Hint: How does the group/orbit construction change if only one kind of symmetry is enforced?*

### Summary

This problem is a *group symmetry* and *state enumeration* pattern (meet in the middle, backtracking over symmetric orbits).  
It applies ideas from set covering, minimum flip for equality in symmetric groups, and recursive search.  
Pattern is common wherever symmetry or paired-constraint groups must be handled together, such as grid coloring, image manipulation, and even palindromic string/grid construction tasks.
