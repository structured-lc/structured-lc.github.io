### Leetcode 3192 (Medium): Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-binary-array-elements-equal-to-one-ii)

### Description  
You are given a binary array **nums** (i.e., contains only 0s and 1s). In one operation, you can choose any index **i** and flip all elements from **i** to the end. "Flipping" means turning 0→1 and 1→0. Your task: **Find the minimum number of such operations needed to make every element in nums equal to 1.** Order of operations and choice of indices are up to you.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [0,0,1,0]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:  
- Flip at index 0 → [1,1,0,1]  
- Flip at index 2 → [1,1,1,0] → [1,1,1,1]*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1,1,0,1,1]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation:  
- Flip at index 2 → [1,1,1,0,0] → [1,1,1,1,1]*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [1,1,1,1]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation:  
- The array already has all 1's. No operation is needed.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

Let's first think brute-force:  
Could we try every possible sequence of flips? That would be exponential and infeasible for large arrays.

Next, think greedy:  
- Since flipping at index **i** affects all elements from **i** to end, every flip undoes all previous flips from this point.
- If the current element, after accounting for previous flips, is 0, it must be flipped (since all to the right will be flipped too).
- So, as we traverse left-to-right, let's track if we're in a "flipped" state (using a variable like flip_parity).
- Whenever encountering a "0" (after adjusting for flips), flip at this position and toggle our flip tracking.

This is an optimal greedy strategy since flipping at the earliest wrong spot minimizes redundant flips.  
Bit manipulation (using XOR) lets us quickly determine the "real" state of the current bit.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty array → Should return 0.
- All elements are already 1.
- All elements are 0.
- Alternating 1s and 0s.
- Single-element arrays: , [1].
- Leading/trailing zeros.

### Solution

```python
def min_operations(nums):
    flips = 0      # Counts operation
    flip_state = 0 # Tracks current global flip (0 or 1)

    for x in nums:
        # If, after prior flips, current bit is zero, we need to flip here
        if x ^ flip_state == 0:
            flips += 1
            flip_state ^= 1 # Toggle flip

    return flips
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of nums, as we traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), only constant extra variables are used, regardless of input size.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you must make all elements 0 instead of 1?  
  *Hint: Reverse interpretation of flip state and comparison target.*

- What if you can only flip at every kᵗʰ index?  
  *Hint: Greedy approach must account for index step, possibly sliding window or skipping strategy.*

- Can you solve if flipping only flips a subarray of length k starting at i?  
  *Hint: Simulate the outcome window-by-window, with additional state tracking.*

### Summary
This problem leverages the **greedy** pattern often seen in binary array flipping tasks, particularly when operations invert a whole suffix or prefix. The bitwise/XOR approach is particularly efficient for tracking parity of flips, and the pattern connects to problems involving "toggle" or "parity tracking" in-place. The problem is a direct application of greedy + bit manipulation and is commonly seen in various disguised forms across array and string toggling situations.
