### Leetcode 3501 (Hard): Maximize Active Section with Trade II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-active-section-with-trade-ii)

### Description  
Given a binary string `s` representing active ('1') and inactive ('0') sections, you may perform **at most one trade**. In a trade, you can choose a contiguous block of '1's (surrounded by '0's or at the ends), and **move** it to another position in the string, possibly merging it with existing '1' sections. Your goal: maximize the number of active sections (consecutive runs of '1's) after the move.

An active "section" is defined as a maximal contiguous substring of '1's.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "10001"`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: You can move the block "1" from index 0 to index 4, merging with the last "1". Final: "00011", which has one active section.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "10101"`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Multiple options: Move any "1" to merge with another, but the best you can do is to have two active sections, such as "11001" or "10011".*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = "110001100"`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Move the block "11" from the start to the end, resulting in "000110011", merging with the last '1' section. Active sections decrease from 2 to 2 (no gain), so answer is 2.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, let's understand the problem:
- We can move a contiguous block of '1's to any other position.
- The goal is to maximize the number of active sections after the move.

**Brute-force approach:**  
Check all possible blocks of '1's, and for each, try moving it to every possible location, recalculating the number of active sections every time. This is too slow for large strings: O(n³).

**Optimization ideas:**  
- Count how many "active sections" there are initially.
- Realize that merging blocks reduces the count, and splitting or dispersing '1's might increase the number—but since we can only move a block, not split it, the best we can do is to **merge sections** to reduce the count, or avoid merging to keep the count high.
- Analyze all blocks of '1's: track start and end indices, lengths.
- For each block, consider the effect of moving it to each gap between blocks or to either end.
- Compute the number of sections in O(n), and try possible moves in O(n log n) using pre-processed lists for efficiency.

This yields an overall time of O(n log n), which is efficient enough.

**Trade-offs:**  
Moving the largest block to maximize the merging with other potential '1's can minimize the section count. Or, by keeping sections separated, maximize the section count. A greedy approach, combined with prefix/suffix computations, can help identify optimal moves.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty string: s = ""
- All '0's
- All '1's
- Only one '1'
- Multiple single '1's separated by one or more '0's
- Overlapping blocks after move
- Blocks at the beginning or end of the string

### Solution

```python
def maximize_active_section_with_trade_ii(s: str) -> int:
    # First, identify all blocks of '1's as (start, end) pairs
    blocks = []
    n = len(s)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s[i] == '1':
            start = i
            while i < n and s[i] == '1':
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            blocks.append((start, end))
        else:
            i += 1

    total_sections = len(blocks)
    if total_sections <= 1:
        return total_sections

    # Since only one move is allowed, try to merge two sections
    # For each block, try moving it to either side of another block, see if merging is possible.
    max_sections = total_sections

    # Evaluate moving each block to each possible gap
    for index, (l, r) in enumerate(blocks):
        length = r - l + 1
        remaining_blocks = blocks[:index] + blocks[index+1:]

        # Build a string without this block
        s2 = list(s)
        for k in range(l, r+1):
            s2[k] = '0'
        # Now try to insert this block at every possible position (between each char, including ends)
        for pos in range(n - length + 1):
            # Skip if overlap with original block
            if pos <= l <= pos + length - 1 or pos <= r <= pos + length - 1:
                continue
            # Form the new string
            temp = s2[:]
            for k in range(length):
                temp[pos+k] = '1'
            # Count sections
            count = 0
            j = 0
            while j < n:
                if temp[j] == '1':
                    count += 1
                    while j < n and temp[j] == '1':
                        j += 1
                else:
                    j += 1
            max_sections = max(max_sections, count)

    return max_sections
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n³) worst-case — For each block (O(n)), for each possible position (O(n)), and for counting sections (O(n)). This can be optimized to O(n²), possibly O(n log n) with careful gap/merging logic.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) — For storing the blocks and modified strings.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you are allowed **more than one** move?  
  *Hint: Consider how merging and splitting blocks with multiple moves changes the optimal sequence.*

- Can you optimize the section counting using a prefix/suffix structure?  
  *Hint: Precompute counts to avoid scanning the string each time.*

- How would you adapt your approach if the array is huge and you cannot afford to copy the string repeatedly?  
  *Hint: Avoid copying, and operate on indices or via in-place simulation.*

### Summary
This problem uses **interval analysis** and **greedy block movement** to optimize a segmentation metric. The approach generalizes to interval/section manipulation on binary sequences, and the block-moving/merging concept appears in problems involving string editing, scheduling, or segmentation optimization. Efficiently enumerating options by analyzing block endpoints and smartly simulating moves is the key pattern applied here.
