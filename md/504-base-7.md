### Leetcode 504 (Easy): Base 7 [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/base-7)

### Description  
Given any integer (could be negative, zero, or positive), return a string representing its value in **base 7**. For example, for base 10, we use digits 0–9; for base 7, we use digits 0–6, with digit positions representing ascending powers of 7 (1, 7, 49, etc). The result should have a leading minus sign if the input was negative – do not include leading zeroes.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `num = 100`  
Output: `"202"`  
*Explanation: 100 in base 7 is 2 × 7² + 0 × 7¹ + 2 × 7⁰ = 98 + 0 + 2 = 100.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `num = -7`  
Output: `"-10"`  
*Explanation: -7 in base 7 is -1 × 7¹ + 0 × 7⁰ = -7 + 0 = -7.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `num = 0`  
Output: `"0"`  
*Explanation: By definition, 0 in base 7 is "0".*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
To convert a number to **base 7**, I’ll use a similar approach as general base conversion.  
1. Handle special case when num == 0: return "0".
2. Handle negatives: store if the input is negative, and work with its absolute value for conversion; prepend '-' to the result at the end if needed.
3. Repeatedly:
   - Find the remainder of num ÷ 7 (num % 7). This gives the least significant digit in base 7.
   - Append this digit to a list (or string builder).
   - Update num: integer divide by 7 (num //= 7).
4. At the end, since we've generated the number from least to most significant digit, **reverse** the result list/array.
5. Prepend minus sign if necessary, then return the joined string.

This approach is simple and follows the mathematical definition of base conversion, without using any built-in Python base conversion tools (like `format()` or `int(str, base)`), which is the standard interview method.

### Corner cases to consider  
- **Zero:** Input is 0, must return "0" (not "", not any sign).
- **Negative numbers:** Output should include "-" sign; no sign for positive.
- **Single-digit input:** 3 → "3", -2 → "-2", should not pad with extra zeros.
- **Large numbers:** Should handle up to 32-bit integer range, both positive and negative.
- **Minimal input value:** Check −2,147,483,648 (minimum 32-bit signed integer).
- **Positive and negative sign handling:** Only one sign; don’t duplicate.

### Solution

```python
def convertToBase7(num: int) -> str:
    # Handle zero case immediately
    if num == 0:
        return "0"
    
    # Remember if number is negative
    negative = num < 0
    num = abs(num)
    
    digits = []
    while num > 0:
        remainder = num % 7        # Get the last digit in base 7
        digits.append(str(remainder))  # Store as string for easy join
        num //= 7                  # Remove the last base 7 digit
    
    # The computed digits are in reverse order; reverse before joining
    base7_str = ''.join(reversed(digits))
    # Return with sign if negative
    return '-' + base7_str if negative else base7_str
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(log₇ n) because each step divides num by 7, so for input with k base-7 digits, need k iterations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(log₇ n) for the storage of the result digits (max ~12 for 32-bit integer), plus the space to build output string.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle conversion to **any base b** (not just 7)?
  *Hint: Replace 7 with b as a general parameter; consider possible alphabet/character set for digits above 9 (bases > 10).*

- Can you write a **recursive** solution for base conversion?
  *Hint: Each call handles num // 7, appends str(num % 7) through the stack.*

- How would you handle **floating-point numbers** for base conversion?
  *Hint: Consider both whole and fractional parts; multiply fraction by base repeatedly for fractional digits.*

### Summary
This problem uses the classic **number base conversion** coding pattern: repeatedly divide the input by the base, collect the remainders, and reverse them for the correct digit order. This method is applicable for any base, not just 7, and is a foundational technique in computer science for parsing and formatting numbers in different numeral systems.
