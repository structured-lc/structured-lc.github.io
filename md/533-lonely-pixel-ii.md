### LeetCode 533 (Medium): Lonely Pixel II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/lonely-pixel-ii)

### Description  
In this problem, we are given a 2D array representing a black-and-white picture (with 'B' denoting black pixels and 'W' denoting white pixels) and a positive integer N. The task is to count the number of black pixels that are considered "lonely." A black pixel is lonely if it is the only black pixel in its row and column, and all rows containing black pixels in the same column must be identical. Additionally, each of these rows must contain exactly N black pixels. 

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: picture = `[["WBW","BWW"],["WBW","BWW"]]`, N = 2  
Output: 2  
*Explanation: The two black pixels in the second column are lonely because they are the only black pixels in their rows, appear in columns with only one black pixel, and all rows containing black pixels in those columns are identical.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: picture = `[["BWB","BBB"],["BBB","BBB"]]`, N = 3  
Output: 0  
*Explanation: Although the black pixels in the second column satisfy some conditions, they are not lonely because not all of them appear in rows with exactly three black pixels.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: picture = `[["BBB","BWB","BBB"],["BBB","BWB","BBB"]]`, N = 1  
Output: 0  
*Explanation: No black pixel is lonely because none of them are the only black pixel in their row.*

### Thought Process  
To approach this problem, we can start with a brute-force idea where we check every pixel and validate its conditions. However, this approach can be slow for large grids. A more efficient approach is to precompute row patterns and counts, which allows us to check each pixel's conditions more quickly. Here’s how we can optimize it:

1. **Precompute Row Counts**: Count the number of black pixels in each row.
2. **Precompute Column Counts**: Count the number of black pixels in each column.
3. **Identify Patterns**: Convert each row into a string to easily compare patterns.
4. **Check Conditions**: For each black pixel, check if it is lonely by verifying that its row and column have exactly one black pixel, and that all rows with black pixels in the same column have the same pattern.

We choose this approach because it balances efficiency with simplicity, reducing the time complexity significantly compared to brute force.

### Corner Cases  
- **Empty Grid**: If the input grid is empty, there are no black pixels to consider.
- **Single Row or Column**: If the grid has only one row or column, no black pixel can be lonely.
- **All Identical Rows**: If all rows are identical, no black pixel can be lonely unless it is the only black pixel in its column.

```python
def findBlackPixel(picture, N):
    # Precompute row counts
    row_counts = [row.count('B') for row in picture]
    
    # Precompute column counts
    col_counts = [sum(row[i] == 'B' for row in picture) for i in range(len(picture[0]))]
    
    # Convert each row into a string for pattern comparison
    row_patterns = [''.join(row) for row in picture]
    
    # Initialize result counter
    res = 0
    
    # Iterate through each pixel
    for i in range(len(picture)):
        for j in range(len(picture[0])):
            # Check if the pixel is black
            if picture[i][j] == 'B':
                # Check if the pixel is lonely in its row and column
                if row_counts[i] == N and col_counts[j] == 1:
                    # Check if all rows with black pixels in the same column are identical
                    matching_rows = [row for row in picture if row[j] == 'B']
                    if len(set([''.join(row) for row in matching_rows])) == 1:
                        res += 1
    return res
```

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(m × n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. This is because we iterate through each pixel once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m + n) for storing row and column counts, and additional space for row patterns.

### Potential Follow-Up Questions  

- **Follow-Up Question 1:**  
  *Hint: Consider a scenario where the condition for a row to be considered identical is modified to include diagonals. How would your approach change?  
- **Follow-Up Question 2:**  
  *Hint: Suppose the grid size is very large, and you need to optimize memory usage. How would you optimize the space complexity of your solution?  
- **Follow-Up Question 3:**  
  *Hint: If the grid can contain more colors (e.g., 'R' for red), how would you extend your solution to count lonely pixels of different colors?*


### Summary  
The approach to solving LeetCode 533 involves precomputing row and column counts, identifying patterns by converting rows into strings, and checking each pixel's conditions for loneliness. This method optimizes time complexity by avoiding redundant comparisons. The solution is an example of optimizing a grid analysis problem using clever precomputation and pattern matching, a common pattern in grid-based problems.
