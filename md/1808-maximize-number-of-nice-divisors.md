### Leetcode 1808 (Hard): Maximize Number of Nice Divisors [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-number-of-nice-divisors)

### Description  
Given an integer **primeFactors**, construct a positive integer **n** using exactly **primeFactors** (not necessarily distinct) prime factors.  
Your goal is to maximize the number of **nice divisors** of **n**.  
A **nice divisor** of **n** is a divisor that is **divisible by every prime factor of n**.  
Return the maximum possible number of nice divisors modulo 1_000_000_007.

#### Example explanation of nice divisor:  
If n = 12, its prime factors are [2,2,3]. Nice divisors must be divisible by both 2 and 3, so nice divisors are 6, 12.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `primeFactors = 5`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation:  
Use n = 200 (200 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5). Its nice divisors are {10, 20, 40, 50, 100, 200}, for a total of 6.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `primeFactors = 8`  
Output: `18`  
Explanation:  
n = 2³ × 3⁵ = 864. The maximum possible number of nice divisors is 18.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `primeFactors = 1`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation:  
Only n=2 is possible. Only divisor (2) is nice.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
The brute-force would be:  
- Generate all integer n with at most primeFactors prime factors, for each, find all nice divisors (divisors divisible by every prime factor), maximize.

But constraints are huge (1 ≤ primeFactors ≤ 10⁹), so brute-force is impossible.

#### Observations:
- The number of nice divisors is maximized when the distribution of exponents among prime factors is as balanced as possible. If n has k distinct primes with exponents a₁, a₂... then the number of nice divisors = a₁ × a₂ × ... × aₖ.
- To maximize their product given a fixed sum (here, the total number of exponents is primeFactors), an optimal result is to make the exponents as close as possible, as in integer-factorization (as in maximizing product of positive integers summing to S).
- For such "integer break" problems, using as many 3’s as possible gives the optimal product (with a few exceptions for small n), because 3 × 3 × … yields greater products than 2’s or larger numbers.

#### So:
- If primeFactors ≤ 3, return primeFactors directly.
- Otherwise, break primeFactors into as many 3’s as possible.  
  - If remainder is 1, adjust last 3’s to form 4 (3+1=4, but 2×2=4 > 3×1=3).  
  - Use fast exponentiation to get the result modulo 1_000_000_007.

### Corner cases to consider  
- primeFactors = 1 ⟶ Only 1 prime factor, only one possible n.
- primeFactors = 2, 3 ⟶ Small numbers should be handled explicitly.
- Large primeFactors (up to 10⁹) ⟶ Need to use efficient exponentiation, avoid overflow.
- Make sure splitting logic for remainder 1, 2 is correct.

### Solution

```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def mod_pow(x, n, mod):
    # Efficient power by squaring
    result = 1
    x = x % mod
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result = result * x % mod
        x = x * x % mod
        n //= 2
    return result

def maxNiceDivisors(primeFactors):
    if primeFactors <= 3:
        return primeFactors

    # Use as many 3's as possible
    quotient = primeFactors // 3
    remainder = primeFactors % 3

    if remainder == 0:
        return mod_pow(3, quotient, MOD)
    elif remainder == 1:
        # Instead of 3+1, use 2+2 (since 2×2=4>3×1=3)
        return mod_pow(3, quotient - 1, MOD) * 4 % MOD
    else:  # remainder == 2
        return mod_pow(3, quotient, MOD) * 2 % MOD
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(log primeFactors) – due to fast exponentiation.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) – uses only a constant amount of extra storage.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)

- What if the problem required maximizing the sum of nice divisors, not their count?  
  *Hint: Analyze divisor sum properties and how the exponent distribution impacts the sum.*

- Could you adapt your algorithm if instead of prime factors, we used any factors?  
  *Hint: Think about factorization properties and combinatorics for non-prime factors.*

- What about listing all nice divisors rather than just their count?  
  *Hint: Discuss generating divisors of n efficiently and checking their properties.*

### Summary
This problem is a variant of the classic **integer break/max product partition** problem – a common dynamic programming and greedy pattern where you split an integer to maximize the product of its parts. Optimally, the integer should be split into pieces of 3 (with rare adjustments for small remainders).  
The efficient solution uses fast modular exponentiation for very large input, and is an excellent interview topic connecting combinatorics, number theory, and algorithm optimization.
