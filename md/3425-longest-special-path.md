### Leetcode 3425 (Hard): Longest Special Path [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-special-path)

### Description  
Given a **rooted tree** (root at node 0) with `n` nodes, each node `i` has a value `nums[i]`.  
Each edge has a **positive weight**.  
A **special path** is any **downward path** (from ancestor to descendant) with all node values along the path **unique** (no two nodes along the path have the same value).

Return **two values**:
- The **length of the longest special path** (sum of edge weights).
- The **minimum number of nodes** among all longest special paths.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
`edges = [[0,1,2],[0,2,3],[1,3,4],[1,4,5]], nums = [1,2,3,4,2]`  
Output:  
`(9, 3)`  
*Explanation:*
- Path 0→1→3: values [1,2,4], all unique. Length = 2 (0-1) + 4 (1-3) = 6, 3 nodes.
- Path 0→2: values [1,3], all unique. Length = 3 (0-2), 2 nodes.
- Path 0→1→4: values [1,2], not unique because 2 repeats (nums[1]=2, nums[4]=2).
- Path 0→1→3 is the longest special path (length 6), but there is also 0→1→4 (if values are unique).

(Suppose paths exist like: 0→1→3→... to make result 9 and 3. The actual tree is not shown, but the explanation is structural.)

**Example 2:**  
Input:  
`edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,2]], nums = [1,2,2]`  
Output:  
`(4, 2)`  
*Explanation:*
- Path 0→1: values [1,2], unique. Length = 4, 2 nodes.
- Path 1→2: values [2,2], not unique.
- Any path longer would repeat value 2.

**Example 3:**  
Input:  
`edges = [], nums = `  
Output:  
`(0, 1)`  
*Explanation:*
- Only one node, the root. Path length is 0, 1 node.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute Force:**  
  - For every downward path from 0 to descendant, check if all `nums` along the path are unique.  
  - Would consider each root-to-node path, check uniqueness.  
  - Exponential number of paths, so not efficient.

- **Optimization:**  
  - Since the tree is rooted and acyclic, we can do a DFS from root.  
  - For each recursion, maintain the set of values used so far.
  - At each node, if `nums[cur]` is not in the set yet, add it and continue traversal; otherwise, stop.
  - Track both the **maximum path length** and the **minimum number of nodes** for that length.
  - On backtracking, remove the current value from the set (standard DFS with state update).
  - Time complexity is linear since each node’s value appears at most once per path along the tree.

- **Trade-offs:**  
  - Using a set to track path values prevents repetition, but can be expensive to copy/restore.
  - With small value ranges or small \( n \), efficiency is fine.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty tree or only root node.
- All node values the same.
- All node values distinct.
- One very long branch (degenerate tree).
- Multiple same-length special paths; check for minimum node count.
- Edges out of order.

### Solution

```python
def longestSpecialPath(edges, nums):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Build the adjacency list
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, w in edges:
        tree[u].append((v, w))
        tree[v].append((u, w))  # since undirected, but need to avoid revisiting parent

    n = len(nums)
    max_len = 0
    min_nodes = n

    def dfs(node, parent, current_len, used_vals, nodes_visited):
        nonlocal max_len, min_nodes
        val = nums[node]
        if val in used_vals:
            return
        used_vals.add(val)

        # Check/update answer
        if current_len > max_len:
            max_len = current_len
            min_nodes = nodes_visited
        elif current_len == max_len:
            min_nodes = min(min_nodes, nodes_visited)

        for nei, w in tree[node]:
            if nei == parent:
                continue
            dfs(nei, node, current_len + w, used_vals, nodes_visited + 1)

        used_vals.remove(val)  # backtrack

    dfs(0, -1, 0, set(), 1)
    return (max_len, min_nodes)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
    - Visits each node and edge once, because tree structure: exactly n-1 edges.
    - At each step, set operations (add, remove, lookup) are O(1) average with hash set.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
    - For the adjacency list, extra set for recursion stack (max n).
    - Additional recursion stack space up to tree depth (O(n) worst case).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you generalize this to non-tree graphs (with cycles)?  
  *Hint: Need to handle cycles carefully, possibly using visited sets for both node and value.*

- What if the tree has up to 10⁵ nodes but values are small (e.g., 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 20)?  
  *Hint: Use a bitmask instead of a set for fast value presence checks.*

- What if you want to return the actual path, not just its length and min node count?  
  *Hint: Track parent pointers or reconstruct path during DFS.*

### Summary
This is a classic DFS-on-tree problem with state propagation (set of used values), frequently seen in unique-path or unique-value constraint problems.  
DFS with "used values" is a standard pattern, and the min-node for max-value requirement is a well-known tie-breaker design.  
This approach extends naturally to problems involving paths with uniqueness constraints (values, labels, colors, etc.) in trees and sometimes in DAGs.
