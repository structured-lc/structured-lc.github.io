### Leetcode 1838 (Medium): Frequency of the Most Frequent Element [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element)

### Description  
You are given an array of integers called `nums` and an integer `k`.  
You can perform at most `k` operations, where each operation means incrementing any one element in the array by 1.  
Your goal is: after performing up to `k` increments, what is the **highest possible frequency** of any element in the array?  
In other words, what is the maximum possible number of times you could have the same value appear in the array after using up to `k` increments?

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,4]`, `k = 5`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Increment 1 by 3 times (1→4), and increment 2 by 2 times (2→4).  
Now nums = [4,4,4], so frequency of 4 is 3.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1,4,8,13]`, `k = 5`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Several options.  
- Increment 1 (by 3) and 4 (by 2) to both reach 4, making two 4's: [4,4,8,13].  
- Or increment 4 (by 4) to reach 8: [1,8,8,13].  
- Or increment 8 (by 5) to reach 13: [1,4,13,13].  
The max frequency for any element is 2.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [3,9,6]`, `k = 2`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: No way to use at most 2 increments to make two values equal, so max possible frequency is 1.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute Force:**  
  For every unique target value in the array, compute the minimum operations needed to make as many other elements as possible match that target by only incrementing elements (since only increases are allowed).  
  Try all targets; decide for each how many elements can be brought up to that value using at most `k` increments.  
  This is too slow for large arrays — \(O(n^2)\).
  
- **Optimization:**  
  1. **Sort `nums`:** Start with a sorted array so we can efficiently consider contiguous groups of numbers.
  2. **Sliding Window:** Fix a right pointer (`r`). For each `r`, expand a window to the left (`l`) as far as possible such that we can spend ≤k increments to bring all nums[l:r+1] up to nums[r].  
  For a subarray nums[l:r+1], total increment needed is:  
  (nums[r] × (r-l+1)) - sum(nums[l]...nums[r])  
  If this is ≤k, try to expand the window. If not, move the left pointer right (l += 1) to shrink.
  3. **Result:** Max window size found = max possible frequency after k increments.

- **Why Sliding Window:**  
  Each window considers making all elements equal to the largest in the window, in the most efficient way (only upward increments).  
  This pattern is common for "at most k operations" + maximizing a contiguous segment.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Array of all equal elements (no increments needed, max freq is n).
- Array with only one element.
- k = 0 (no operations allowed).
- k very large (can make all elements equal).
- Large numbers where sum may overflow — use long/integer carefully.
- Gaps in sorted array are very large (sometimes cannot increase even two elements).

### Solution

```python
def maxFrequency(nums, k):
    # Sort nums so equalizations are easier to track
    nums.sort()
    left = 0
    total = 0  # Total increments needed for current window
    res = 1

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        # Add the extra increments needed if expanding window to right
        # (nums[right] - nums[right-1]) × (window size), but done cumulatively
        total += nums[right]
        
        # Window size = right - left + 1
        # Total increments to make all elements in window equal to nums[right]:
        # nums[right] × window_size - total
        while nums[right] * (right - left + 1) - total > k:
            total -= nums[left]
            left += 1  # Shrink window
        
        res = max(res, right - left + 1)
    
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(n log n) due to sorting, and O(n) for the sliding window, so overall **O(n log n)**.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(1) extra space (not counting input), as all manipulations use constant extra variables.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If you could decrement elements as well as increment, how would your approach change?  
  *Hint: Now you can match values either up or down. Maybe try to choose a target and count both increments and decrements for each window.*

- What if each increment by 1 had a different cost per element (given in a separate array)?  
  *Hint: Try a greedy + priority queue, since per-operation cost differs.*

- Can you find all possible window ranges producing this maximum frequency, not just the value?  
  *Hint: Record start and end indices whenever a new max is found.*

### Summary
This problem uses the **sorting + sliding window** pattern, efficiently expanding and contracting a window to track the best possible segment with at most k total operations.  
This approach is widely applicable to problems involving "make all elements equal under a budget", "max subarray under sum constraint", or similar transformation scenarios.  
Key trick: pre-sort and use window total to avoid re-counting work.
