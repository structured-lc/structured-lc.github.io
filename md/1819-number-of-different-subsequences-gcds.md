### Leetcode 1819 (Hard): Number of Different Subsequences GCDs [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-different-subsequences-gcds)

### Description  
You are given an array of positive integers. Return the number of different GCDs (Greatest Common Divisors) among all non-empty subsequences of the array. A subsequence is derived by deleting some (possibly zero) elements without changing the order of remaining elements.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [6,10,3]`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation: Subsequences and their GCDs: [6]→6, [10]→10, [3]→3, [6,10]→2, [6,3]→3, [10,3]→1, [6,10,3]→1. Distinct GCDs: {6,10,3,2,1} = 5 different values.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [5,15,40,5,6]`  
Output: `7`  
*Explanation: Many subsequences possible, but distinct GCDs are {5,15,40,1,3,6,10}, giving 7 different values.*

### Thought Process (as if you're the interviewee)  
This is a complex combinatorial problem involving GCD calculations. The naive approach of generating all subsequences would be O(2ⁿ), which is too slow.

Key insights:
1. **GCD upper bound**: The GCD of any subsequence cannot exceed the maximum element in the array
2. **Divisibility check**: For a number g to be a valid GCD, it must divide all elements in some subsequence
3. **Bottom-up approach**: Instead of generating subsequences, check for each possible GCD value if it can be achieved

My approach:
1. **Find candidates**: All possible GCD values are divisors of array elements
2. **Check feasibility**: For each candidate GCD g, see if we can form a subsequence with GCD exactly g
3. **Use GCD properties**: If g divides multiple elements, their GCD might be g or a multiple of g

### Corner cases to consider  
- Single element array
- Array with duplicate elements  
- Array where all elements share a common factor
- Array with coprime elements (GCD = 1)
- Very large numbers
- Array with elements that are multiples of each other

### Solution

```python
def countDifferentSubsequenceGCDs(nums):
    # Remove duplicates and find maximum value
    num_set = set(nums)
    max_val = max(nums)
    
    valid_gcds = set()
    
    # Check each possible GCD value from 1 to max_val
    for gcd_candidate in range(1, max_val + 1):
        # Find all multiples of gcd_candidate that exist in nums
        multiples = []
        for multiple in range(gcd_candidate, max_val + 1, gcd_candidate):
            if multiple in num_set:
                multiples.append(multiple)
        
        # If no multiples found, this GCD is impossible
        if not multiples:
            continue
        
        # Check if GCD of all multiples equals gcd_candidate
        current_gcd = multiples[0]
        for i in range(1, len(multiples)):
            current_gcd = gcd(current_gcd, multiples[i])
            # Early termination if GCD becomes smaller than candidate
            if current_gcd < gcd_candidate:
                break
        
        # If the GCD equals our candidate, it's valid
        if current_gcd == gcd_candidate:
            valid_gcds.add(gcd_candidate)
    
    return len(valid_gcds)

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(max_val × log(max_val) × count_multiples) where max_val is the maximum element. For each candidate GCD, we find its multiples and compute their GCD.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the set of unique numbers and the valid GCDs set.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you're the interviewer)  

- How would you optimize for cases where the array has many small repeated values?  
  *Hint: Use frequency counting and mathematical properties of GCD to reduce redundant calculations.*

- Can you solve this using dynamic programming on GCD values?  
  *Hint: Track which GCD values are achievable and build up from smaller to larger values.*

- What if the array could contain negative numbers?  
  *Hint: Take absolute values since GCD is defined for positive integers.*

### Summary
This problem demonstrates the intersection of number theory and combinatorics. The key insight is to iterate through possible GCD values rather than subsequences, using the mathematical property that valid GCDs must be divisors of array elements. This pattern appears in problems involving divisibility, GCD/LCM calculations, and optimization over mathematical constraints.
