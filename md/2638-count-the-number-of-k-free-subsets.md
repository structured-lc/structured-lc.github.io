### Leetcode 2638 (Medium): Count the Number of K-Free Subsets [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-k-free-subsets)

### Description  
Given an integer array nums with **distinct elements** and an integer k, count all subsets of nums such that **no two elements in any chosen subset differ by exactly k**.  
A subset can be any selection (including the empty set and singletons).  
Return the total number of such "k-Free" subsets.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [4, 1, 5, 2], k = 3`  
Output: `8`  
*Explanation: Subsets possible are: [], [1], [2], [4], [5], [1,2], [4,1], [5,2].  
Subsets like [1,4] (since 4-1=3) and [2,5] (since 5-2=3) are NOT k-free.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 1`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation: Only the subsets [], [1], [2], [3], and [4] are valid.  
Any subset with more than one element must include two consecutive numbers, which differ by k=1.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [1, 4, 7, 10], k = 3`  
Output: `16`  
*Explanation: All subsets are allowed (since all pairs differ by 3, which is k, but since subset can only contain one of each gap, any subset with two or more elements never repeats the same gap, so total = 2⁴ = 16).*  

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, a brute-force approach is to generate all 2ⁿ subsets and check, for each, whether any two elements differ by exactly k. This is clearly **too slow for n ≈ 20+**.

Instead, note that **any two elements whose difference is k cannot both be in the same subset**.  
Sort nums and think of the graph: connect two elements if they differ by k; the adjacency forms a collection of **chains (or isolated elements)**.

For each such chain, the valid subsets are similar to the "House Robber" pattern (choose subset with no two adjacent elements).  
For a sorted segment [a, a+k, a+2k,...] we need to count all subsets with no two consecutive elements. This is a standard DP (dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) pattern.

Break nums into **disconnected groups** where for each group, all elements are connected by multiples of k. For each group, count k-free subsets using DP, then the answer is the **product** of all group answers.

This avoids checking all subsets directly and exploits the structure created by k-differences.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty array: should return 1 (only the empty set)
- k is very large: if no two elements differ by k, return 2ⁿ
- All nums are spaced by at least k+1: again, 2ⁿ possibilities
- nums has only 1 element: return 2
- k = 0 (should never happen since |a-b|=0 would mean two equal elements, which is forbidden by constraints)
- Elements not sorted, but need to group by mod k chains

### Solution

```python
def countTheNumOfKFreeSubsets(nums, k):
    # Sort nums to process sequences easier
    nums.sort()
    from collections import defaultdict

    groups = defaultdict(list)
    # Group nums by modulus k
    for num in nums:
        groups[num % k].append(num)
    
    res = 1
    for group in groups.values():
        n = len(group)
        # For current group, we use 'House Robber' DP
        # dp[i] = number of k-free subsets among first i elements
        # Let dp[0] = 1 (empty set), dp[1] = 2 ([ ] or first element)
        dp_prev2 = 1
        dp_prev1 = 2
        for i in range(1, n):
            # if current and previous element differ by k,
            # we cannot pick both, i.e. standard house-robber.
            if group[i] - group[i-1] == k:
                dp_curr = dp_prev1 + dp_prev2
            else:
                dp_curr = dp_prev1 * 2
            dp_prev2, dp_prev1 = dp_prev1, dp_curr
        res *= dp_prev1
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n): Sorting nums takes O(n log n). Grouping and processing each group is O(n). Total dominated by sorting.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n): storing groups, plus a few DP variables for each group.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would this change if nums could have duplicate elements?  
  *Hint: Tweaks to subsets logic and duplicate handling.*

- Could you compute the answer modulo 10⁹+7 for large n?  
  *Hint: Adjust multiplication for modular overflow.*

- What if the forbidden difference set was more general than just {k}?  
  *Hint: Generalize grouping and incidence structure.*

### Summary
This problem reduces to **partitioning nums into modulus-k groups**, then, for each, running a "no two adjacent selected" DP (house robber) pattern. The result is the **product** of valid subset counts from all groups. This DP pattern is standard in subset/adjacency/interval selection problems (e.g., House Robber, Fibonacci-tiling). The grouping trick is due to the forbidden difference property, which creates **independent chains** that are processed separately.
