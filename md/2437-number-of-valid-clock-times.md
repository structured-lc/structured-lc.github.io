### Leetcode 2437 (Easy): Number of Valid Clock Times [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-clock-times)

### Description  
Given a string `time` of length 5 representing the current time in the "hh:mm" 24-hour format (from "00:00" to "23:59"), where some digits may be unknown and denoted by '?', replace every '?' with a digit (0-9) to count how many valid times can be created. A valid time respects the hours in [00, 23] and minutes in [00, 59].

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `"?5:00"`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: The '?' can be '0' or '1', producing "05:00" and "15:00". '25:00' is invalid.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `"0?:0?"`  
Output: `100`  
*Explanation: '?' in hour can be 0-9 to make "00" to "09"; '?' in minute can be 0-9, so 10 × 10 = 100 possibilities.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `"?4:5?"`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation: '?' as '0' or '1' to make "04" or "14", minute '?' as 0-9, but "24:5x" is invalid, so 2 × 10 = 20 but only "04" and "14" are valid hour tens.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, I would consider brute-forcing all possible replacements for each '?', generating every possible "hh:mm" and checking if the result is within the valid range. However, since there are only 4 digits that could be '?', the maximum computation is small (10⁴).

Optimally, I can separately calculate the number of valid options for the hour part and the minute part:
- For hour 'hh', handle each '?' position: 
  - If both digits are '?', possible values are 00 to 23 (24 possibilities).
  - If one digit is '?', consider whether replacements retain results in 00-23.
- For minute 'mm', '?' can generate 00 to 59 (if both '?', 60 options).

Multiply the possible hour and minute options together for the final answer.

This is highly efficient as all logic can be captured in a few conditional checks, with constant operations (not dependent on input size).

### Corner cases to consider  
- All digits are '?': "??:??" (should return 24 × 60 = 1440).
- Time with only one '?' in hour or one in minute.
- Invalid possibilities: e.g., hour digit replaced so result >23, minute digit replaced so result >59.
- Time is already valid with no '?' (should return 1).

### Solution

```python
def countTime(time: str) -> int:
    # Compute ways for hour part
    h = 0
    if time[0] == '?' and time[1] == '?':
        h = 24  # "00" to "23"
    elif time[0] == '?':
        # First digit ?; depends on 2nd digit
        if time[1] <= '3':
            h = 3  # 0,1,2 as first digit
        else:
            h = 2  # Only 0 or 1 as first digit
    elif time[1] == '?':
        # Second digit ?; depends on 1st digit
        if time[0] == '2':
            h = 4  # 20,21,22,23
        else:
            h = 10  # 00-09, 10-19, etc.
    else:
        # No ?
        hour = int(time[:2])
        h = 1 if 0 <= hour <= 23 else 0

    # Compute ways for minute part
    m = 0
    if time[3] == '?' and time[4] == '?':
        m = 60  # "00" to "59"
    elif time[3] == '?':
        m = 6  # 0-5 for first digit
    elif time[4] == '?':
        m = 10  # 0-9 for second digit
    else:
        minute = int(time[3:])
        m = 1 if 0 <= minute <= 59 else 0

    return h * m
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(1)  
  Only a constant number of checks and simple calculations regardless of the input.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  No extra storage beyond a few primitive variables.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you adapt this if the format allowed times like "h:mm" or "hh:m"?  
  *Hint: Consider which digits matter for validation and ranges for single-digit cases.*

- What if the wildcard was not just '?' but also supported character ranges, e.g. '[1-3]'?  
  *Hint: Enumerate all valid substitutions using the range for each slot and cross product.*

- How would you handle a version with milliseconds, e.g., "hh:mm:ss"?  
  *Hint: Apply the same idea, extending logic for the extra section.*

### Summary
This approach uses straightforward combinatorial reasoning for filling digits independently and multiplies the options for hours and minutes. It's a classic case of digit-mask combinatorics for constrained representations, applicable in other problems involving generating valid codes or times from templates with wildcards. The solution avoids full enumeration and uses mathematical casework, ensuring efficiency and readability.
