### Leetcode 3454 (Hard): Separate Squares II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/separate-squares-ii)

### Description  
Given a list of **n** axis-aligned squares on a 2D plane, each described by `[xᵢ, yᵢ, lᵢ]`, where `(xᵢ, yᵢ)` is the bottom-left corner and `lᵢ` is the side length. We must find the **minimum y-coordinate** of a horizontal line such that the **total area covered above the line equals the total area covered below the line**. Squares may overlap. Answers within 1e-5 of the actual answer are accepted.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `squares = [[0, 0, 2], [1, 1, 2]]`  
Output: `2.0`  
*Explanation: The line y=2 splits the total covered area (not sum of individual square areas) evenly: area above equals area below.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `squares = [[0, 0, 1], [2, 2, 1]]`  
Output: `1.5`  
*Explanation: The line y=1.5 horizontally divides the union of both squares into areas of equal size.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `squares = [[1, 1, 4], [2, 2, 2], [6, 0, 3]]`  
Output: `3.0`  
*Explanation: The answer line y=3.0 splits the total covered area perfectly.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute-force approach:**  
  Try each possible `y` value, compute total area above and below. But area calculations are tricky: union area with overlaps is hard to compute directly for each y (need sweep line or inclusion-exclusion, which is expensive). This is far too slow: O((possible y) × n²).
- **Observation:**  
  The area covered **above/below a y-line** is a monotonic function in y. As y increases, area below increases, area above decreases.
- **Optimization:**  
  We can binary search for `y` such that area below y = area above y, because the function is monotonic.
- **Efficient area calculation:**  
  For a given `y`, the **area below** is the union area of all squares clipped below `y`.  
  Use a *sweep line* approach: project all active square segments onto x-axis, at each y-interval, and calculate their union. **Line sweep** is O(n log n) per area query if implemented efficiently, or use segment tree.
- **Overall approach:**  
  - Total covered area is precomputed.
  - Binary search for minimal `y` such that area below is half the total area.
  - At each query for `y`, compute the area of the union of all the covered squares _below_ `y`.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty input: no squares (undefined problem; should return 0 or error).
- Disjoint squares: line may fall between any two, not on a square.
- Overlapping squares: must count union, not the sum, to avoid double counting.
- All squares stacked vertically or horizontally.
- Answer at or on square edge (e.g., bottom or top).
- Single square: answer is y = y₀ + ⌊l/2⌋.

### Solution

```python
def separateSquares(squares):
    # Helper to compute total union area for all squares clipped below y
    def compute_area_below(line_y):
        # Collect relevant x-intervals for each square that extends below line_y
        intervals = []
        for x, y, l in squares:
            if y >= line_y:
                continue
            y1 = y
            y2 = min(y + l, line_y)
            if y2 <= y1:
                continue
            intervals.append((x, x + l, y1, y2))
        # Sweep line along y, use events: entering and exiting rectangles
        # For all y-intervals in events, sweep along x to count area per y-interval
        events = []
        for x1, x2, y1, y2 in intervals:
            events.append((y1, 1, x1, x2))
            events.append((y2, -1, x1, x2))
        events.sort()
        
        import bisect
        x_points = sorted(set([x for x,_,_ in [(x1, x2, y1) for x1, x2, _, _ in intervals] for x in (x1, x2)]))
        
        area = 0
        count = [0] * (len(x_points) - 1)
        prev_y = None
        for y, typ, x1, x2 in events:
            if prev_y is not None and any(count):
                covered = 0
                for i in range(len(count)):
                    if count[i]:
                        covered += x_points[i+1] - x_points[i]
                area += covered * (y - prev_y)
            for i in range(len(x_points)-1):
                if x1 <= x_points[i] < x2:
                    count[i] += typ
            prev_y = y
        return area
    
    # Compute total area = area union of all squares
    # Use the same sweep line but for the full squares' regions
    def total_area():
        intervals = [(x, x + l, y, y + l) for x, y, l in squares]
        events = []
        for x1, x2, y1, y2 in intervals:
            events.append((y1, 1, x1, x2))
            events.append((y2, -1, x1, x2))

            if prev_y is not None and any(count):
                covered = 0
                for i in range(len(count)):
                    if count[i]:
                        covered += x_points[i+1] - x_points[i]
                area += covered * (y - prev_y)
            for i in range(len(x_points) - 1):
                if x1 <= x_points[i] < x2:
                    count[i] += typ
            prev_y = y
        return area
    
    # Binary search for answer
    ys = []
    for x, y, l in squares:
        ys.append(y)
        ys.append(y + l)
    lo = min(ys)
    hi = max(ys)
    total = total_area()
    eps = 1e-7
    for _ in range(50):
        mid = (lo + hi) / 2
        below = compute_area_below(mid)
        if below * 2 < total:
            lo = mid
        else:
            hi = mid
    return hi
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n² log n + n log(max_y_range/eps)):  
  - For each binary search iteration (log(max_y_range/eps)), we redo a sweep line.
  - Each sweep (area calculation) takes O(n²) in worst-case, as there may be n rectangles and n x-events per level.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n):  
  - Storage for events and coordinate lists.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you optimize the area calculation if the number of squares is huge?  
  *Hint: Segment tree or interval trees for managing x-intervals efficiently.*

- What if the query is online: find the best `y` after every square addition/deletion?  
  *Hint: Dynamic segment tree, persistent data structures.*

- How would your solution change if the rectangles are not axis-aligned squares but arbitrary rectangles?  
  *Hint: The sweep-line idea remains, but data structure for intervals requires more generality.*

### Summary  
This problem uses the **binary search on the answer** technique on a monotonic function, combined with a 2D sweep line for efficient union area calculation below a candidate y. The coding pattern is very useful for geometric set-union, area queries, and root-finding on monotonic set functions. This pattern is common in computational geometry, e.g., for union-of-rectangles/lowering/threshold problems.
