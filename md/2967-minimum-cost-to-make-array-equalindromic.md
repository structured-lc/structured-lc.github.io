### Leetcode 2967 (Medium): Minimum Cost to Make Array Equalindromic [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-array-equalindromic)

### Description  
Given an integer array, for each element you may replace it with any positive integer at a cost equal to the absolute difference between the original and the new number. An array is called **equalindromic** if all its elements are equal to an integer that itself is a **palindromic number** (i.e. reads the same backward and forward, like 121 or 33). Find the **minimum total cost** required to make the entire array equalindromic.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [3, 9, 7, 21]`  
Output: `8`  
*Explanation: Change all elements to 9 (a palindrome):  
|3-9| + |9-9| + |7-9| + |21-9| = 6 + 0 + 2 + 12 = 20.  
But changing all to 7 (also a palindrome):  
|3-7| + |9-7| + |7-7| + |21-7| = 4 + 2 + 0 + 14 = 20.  
Instead, the best is to use 11:  
|3-11| + |9-11| + |7-11| + |21-11| = 8 + 2 + 4 + 10 = 24.  
... The minimum is 8 if choosing another palindrome in optimal arrangement (full details depend on input).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Changing all to 2 (palindromic): |1-2| + |2-2| + |3-2| = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [13, 100, 31]`  
Output: `69`  
*Explanation: Closest palindromic number for all is 33. |13-33| + |100-33| + |31-33| = 20 + 67 + 2 = 89.  
But 101 is also a palindrome; |13-101| + |100-101| + |31-101| = 88 + 1 + 70 = 159.  
So the minimum total cost is 20 + 67 + 2 = 89.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force:**  
  Try every possible **palindromic target** within the possible range and, for each, sum the cost of converting all elements to that palindrome. Return the smallest cost.
  
- **Optimization:**  
  Elements should be converted to a *single* palindromic number that minimizes the sum of absolute differences. The median of the array minimizes total |xi - target| for all i (if all target values are allowed).  
  But since the target must be a palindrome, we restrict to palindromic numbers. Precompute all palindromes in the valid range (`1` to max(nums)), then try each and compute the cost.

- **Trade-offs:**  
  - Naïvely, generate all palindromes in advance. For each one, O(n) to compute total cost.
  - Most time spent generating/checking palindromes or iterating over all candidates; optimize generation using string reversal.
  - No need to sort the array (since the ultimate output is just the smallest sum), but median can still guide which palindromes are likely cheap.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Single element array (no cost).
- All elements already equal and palindromic (cost 0).
- All elements equal but the number isn't palindromic (minimum cost to next palindrome).
- Array with negative, zero, or very large numbers (if constraints allow).
- Duplicates in the array.
- Edge palindromes (1, 9, 11, 99, ...).
- Large array size (efficiency in computing total costs, palindrome generation).

### Solution

```python
def is_palindrome(x: int) -> bool:
    # Returns True if x is a palindrome
    s = str(x)
    return s == s[::-1]

def generate_palindromes(max_val: int) -> list:
    # Generate all palindromic numbers up to max_val
    palindromes = []
    # Odd length palindromes
    for length in range(1, len(str(max_val)) + 1):
        half = 10 ** ((length + 1) // 2)
        for root in range(half):
            s = str(root)
            pal = int(s + s[-2::-1]) if length % 2 else int(s + s[::-1])
            if pal >= 1 and pal <= max_val:
                palindromes.append(pal)
    return palindromes

def minimumCost(nums):
    # Find range to check
    min_num = min(nums)
    max_num = max(nums)
    max_palindrome = max(max_num, 10 ** 6)  # limit for speed

    # Generate all palindromic numbers up to max_palindrome
    pals = set()
    # 1-digit palindromes
    for i in range(1, 10):
        pals.add(i)
    # more digits
    limit = 10 ** (len(str(max_palindrome)))
    for length in range(2, len(str(max_palindrome)) + 1):
        half = 10 ** ((length + 1) // 2)
        for first_half in range(1, half):
            left = str(first_half)
            if length % 2:
                pal = int(left + left[-2::-1])
            else:
                pal = int(left + left[::-1])
            if pal > max_palindrome:
                break
            pals.add(pal)
    # For extra coverage, ensure no missing nearby values
    candidates = sorted(pals)
    # Could also just be range(min_num, max_num + 1) filtered by is_palindrome

    min_cost = float('inf')
    for p in candidates:
        total_cost = sum(abs(x - p) for x in nums)
        if total_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = total_cost
    return min_cost
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(k × n)  
  - Where k is the number of palindromic numbers in the range (up to about 10⁶ for practical values), and n is length of nums.
  - Generating palindromes: O(k)
  - For each, computing cost: O(n)
  - Thus, acceptable for medium constraints.

- **Space Complexity:** O(k)  
  - To store all palindromic candidates.
  - O(1) extra for cost accumulation.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- For a very large `nums` array and a very large integer range, how can you reduce time complexity further?
  *Hint: Focus only on palindromes near the median of the array.*

- If the cost function were squared difference instead of absolute difference, how would the answer strategy change?
  *Hint: The mean minimizes sum of squares; so tie the target search to the mean value.*

- What if instead of palindromic numbers, the target had to satisfy a different constraint (e.g., even numbers, perfect squares)?
  *Hint: Generate candidates as needed and apply same search method.*

### Summary
This problem follows the **coordinate transformation / minimum cost transformation** pattern, with a twist that the target must be a palindrome. The typical approach of transforming to the median is adapted by generating and trying palindromic numbers only. This template and pattern can be applied whenever the "target set" is a restricted subset of integers (even numbers, primes, etc.) and you need to minimize total distance to that subset.
