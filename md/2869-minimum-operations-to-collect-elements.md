### Leetcode 2869 (Easy): Minimum Operations to Collect Elements [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-collect-elements)

### Description  
Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, you can remove one element at a time from the **end** of the array and add it to your *collection*. Your goal is to determine the **minimum number of operations (removals from the end)** needed to collect **all integers from 1 to k** at least once. Only numbers ≤ k are relevant; elements greater than k can be ignored. Return the fewest removals needed so that every number from 1 to k is collected.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3], k = 3`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: Remove from the end, in this order: 3, 4, 2, 1 (last four elements). After these steps, elements 1, 2, and 3 have all been collected.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [5,2,4,1,3,2], k = 2`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: Remove 2, 3, 1, 4 (last four elements, from right to left), collecting both 1 and 2 in the process.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [1,1,1,1], k = 1`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: The last element is 1, so it only takes 1 removal to collect all required numbers (just 1 in this case).*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, notice that the only way to collect elements is to pop from the end (rightmost) of the array. For every number ≤ k we see as we pop, we need to collect it (avoid duplicates). Our task is to **count how many pops** are needed until all numbers from 1 to k have been collected at least once.

**Brute-force idea:**  
- For each pop (from right), keep track of which numbers ≤ k have been collected using something like a set.
- Continue until the set contains all numbers from 1 to k.

**Optimization:**  
- Since sets have O(1) lookup/insert, we can just pop and insert to set for each element (leftover elements or duplicates or numbers > k are ignored).
- As soon as we've seen all k unique numbers, we stop and return the number of pops performed.

**Trade-offs:**  
Minimal extra space is required—just a set of ≤ k elements. This is the optimal approach, O(n) in time and O(k) space, and can't be further refined, since every element may need to be popped in the worst-case scenario.

### Corner cases to consider  
- nums contains multiple duplicates of 1..k.
- nums contains numbers greater than k (ignore them).
- nums is shorter than k (problem statement implies 1..k must all appear at least once, so assume it's valid if they're present).
- k = 1 (collect only 1).
- All required elements 1..k appear only at the very end.
- nums contains only elements > k (should never happen based on constraints).
- nums already ends with all 1..k with no extra elements.

### Solution

```python
def min_operations(nums, k):
    # Track collected numbers (only those ≤ k)
    collected = set()
    # Traverse from right to left (reverse index)
    n = len(nums)
    for ops in range(1, n + 1):
        num = nums[-ops]
        if num <= k:
            collected.add(num)
        # If we've collected all 1..k, return ops
        if len(collected) == k:
            return ops
    # As per problem, it's guaranteed we can collect 1..k
    # so code should never reach here
    return -1
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n),  
  We may need to inspect every element in nums once if all 1..k are at the very start.
- **Space Complexity:** O(k),  
  We store up to k collected numbers in a set.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if we needed to collect numbers from 1 to k but could remove from either end (left or right) of the array, not just from the end?  
  *Hint: Try a two-pointer or greedy approach, or even BFS/DP for minimal removals.*

- Suppose you wanted to minimize the sum of indices (instead of removals count) needed to collect all 1..k by removing elements in any order?  
  *Hint: Think in terms of shortest covering subsequences/intersections.*

- How would you modify the solution if k is very large (≫ n) but only small numbers in nums?  
  *Hint: Hashing, bitsets, or additional preprocessing for checking missing numbers efficiently.*

### Summary
We used a **right-to-left scan** with a set to track collected numbers ≤ k, stopping as soon as all required numbers are seen. This solution leverages the **greedy**/hash set pattern and is a direct simulation of the process. Similar patterns arise in problems where you have to cover a collection of required elements using a sliding window or by popping/dropping items from a sequence.
