### Leetcode 906 (Hard): Super Palindromes [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/super-palindromes)

### Description  
Given two strings, left and right, each representing a positive integer, count how many numbers x within the range [left, right], inclusive, are *super-palindromes*.  
A **super-palindrome** is a positive integer that:
- Is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and
- Is a perfect square whose square root is also a palindrome.

For example, for x = 121:
- 121 is a palindrome,
- 121 = 11 × 11, and 11 is also a palindrome.

The goal is to **find and count all such super-palindromes within the given range.**

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `left="4"`, `right="1000"`  
Output: `4`  
Explanation: Super-palindromes in [4, 1000] are 4 (2²), 9 (3²), 121 (11²), 484 (22²).
All of these and their square roots are palindromes.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `left="1"`, `right="2"`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: Only 1 (1²) is in the range and both 1 and its root are palindromes.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `left="40000000000000000"`, `right="50000000000000000"`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: There are 2 super-palindromes in this big range. The details depend on the palindromic square roots and their palindromic squares.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The brute-force approach would check every number between left and right, for each:
  - Test if it's a palindrome.
  - Test if it's a perfect square, and check if its root is also a palindrome.
- With constraints up to 10¹⁸, brute-force is utterly infeasible.
- **Optimization:**  
  - Any super-palindrome x is a square of some k: x = k².
  - Both x and k must be palindromes.
  - Rather than loop over every x, **generate all palindromic k** such that k² is between left and right, and check if k² is a palindrome.
  - As left, right can be large (≤ 10¹⁸), k can be up to 10⁹.
  - **Generate all palindromic numbers up to √(10¹⁸) = 10⁹, check each k:**
    - If k² in range and palindrome, count it.
  - For k, both odd- and even-length palindromes must be handled (e.g., 12321, 1221).

- **Strategy:**  
  - Generate palindromic roots up to 10⁹.
  - For each k, check if:
    - k² in [left, right],
    - k² is a palindrome.
  - Efficient generation by constructing palindromic numbers digit by digit (odd and even length separately).

### Corner cases to consider  
- The range may have only one value or none at all.
- The lower or upper bound itself may be a super-palindrome.
- Very large numbers (input near upper bound).
- Single-digit numbers (as all are palindromic).
- Numbers like 676 (26×26=676: 676 is a palindrome but 26 is not, so not super-palindrome).

### Solution

```python
def superpalindromesInRange(left: str, right: str) -> int:
    # Helper to check if a number is palindrome
    def is_palindrome(x: str) -> bool:
        return x == x[::-1]

    L = int(left)
    R = int(right)
    MAGIC = 100_000  # Generate palindromic roots up to 10⁵

    count = 0

    # Generate odd length palindromes
    for k in range(1, MAGIC):
        s = str(k)
        # Create odd palindrome (e.g., 12321)
        palindrome = int(s + s[-2::-1])
        square = palindrome * palindrome
        if square > R:
            break
        if square >= L and is_palindrome(str(square)):
            count += 1

    # Generate even length palindromes
    for k in range(1, MAGIC):
        s = str(k)
        # Create even palindrome (e.g., 1221)
        palindrome = int(s + s[::-1])
        square = palindrome * palindrome
        if square > R:
            break
        if square >= L and is_palindrome(str(square)):
            count += 1

    return count
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  For each root palindrome (up to MAGIC ≈ 10⁵), we generate both even and odd palindromes (≈ 2 × 10⁵), and for each, check palindrome status for its square (up to 2 × 10⁵ checks, each O(len(square))).  
  The approach is efficient because the number of candidate roots is much smaller than the 10⁹ bound.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(1) extra (excluding output and input variables), only iterators and temporary storage for strings and integers used.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle counting super-palindromes in an **open-ended range** or streaming input?
  *Hint: Precompute all super-palindromes up to 10¹⁸ and use binary search.*

- Can this approach be generalized to **k-palindromes** (where x, x¹Ꮟᵏ are all palindromes)?
  *Hint: The principle is similar—generate palindromic roots, raise to k, check palindromicity.*

- Is it possible to **further optimize** by avoiding unnecessary palindrome checks for squares?
  *Hint: Consider properties of palindromic number multiplication and bounding.*

### Summary
The solution leverages *palindrome generation* up to a manageable limit and only squares candidate roots, dramatically reducing the search space from the whole interval to potential palindrome squares. This approach combines *smart generation* (constructing numbers digit by digit) and *palindrome property checks*—a common coding pattern for "palindromic number" problems, appearing in advanced number theory and combinatorial coding challenges.
