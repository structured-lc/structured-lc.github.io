### Leetcode 1954 (Medium): Minimum Garden Perimeter to Collect Enough Apples [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-garden-perimeter-to-collect-enough-apples)

### Description  
Imagine an infinite 2D grid, with a tree at the origin (0,0). Every point with integer coordinates (x, y) has some apples, determined by the formula: the cell at (x, y) produces (|x| + |y|) apples per year.  
You're asked: What's the **minimum perimeter** of a square garden (centered at the origin, with sides parallel to axes) that will ensure the total apples within (and on) the square is at least the given `neededApples` value? The perimeter is measured as 4 × side length of the square.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `neededApples = 1`  
Output: `8`  
*Explanation: The smallest square has side length 2 (so from -1 to 1 in x and y), perimeter 8. The apples at (0,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1) sum to at least 1.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `neededApples = 13`  
Output: `16`  
*Explanation: Side length 4 (width from -2 to 2), perimeter = 16. By counting all apples in the 5×5 square, the total equals or exceeds 13.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `neededApples = 1000000000`  
Output: `5040`  
*Explanation: The minimum square perimeter to collect at least 1,000,000,000 apples is 5040.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Naive/brute-force:**  
  Try increasing the side length of the centered square, sum all apples within, and stop when we reach at least `neededApples`. But the grid is infinite and the apple count grows quickly, so simulating every square is too slow.

- **Mathematical analysis:**  
  Notice apple count grows quickly with layer distance. If we look at all grid points at distance n from the origin (i.e., border of square at that "layer"), each layer gives a fixed extra number of apples.  
  For a square of side 2n (i.e., coordinates from -n to n), we can derive a formula for total apples within that square.  
  The **key formula** is:  
  Total apples inside square out to layer n = 2 × n × (n + 1) × (2n + 1)

- **Optimization:**  
  Since number of apples increases fast, for a large `neededApples`, we can use **binary search** on n (layer number or "half side length"), and for each n, compute total apples from the formula; this allows us to efficiently find the minimum n such that total apples ≥ neededApples.

- **Result:**  
  Once we have minimal n, the corresponding square has perimeter = n × 8 (since each side is length 2n, perimeter = 4 × 2n = 8n).

### Corner cases to consider  
- neededApples very small (e.g. 1, or just slightly more than the previous layer’s sum)
- neededApples very large (edge of 64-bit integer)
- Make sure calculation formula does not overflow (use `long`/`int64`)
- The apples gap: test if the required sum is exactly on a boundary versus needing to go up to next layer
- If neededApples is 0 (should return minimal nonzero perimeter, which is 8)

### Solution

```python
def minimumPerimeter(neededApples):
    # Use binary search to find the minimal n
    left = 1
    right = 10**6   # More than enough: n = 10^4 gives apples > 10^12
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        # Apples in square of width 2*mid:
        # Formula: apples = 2 * mid * (mid + 1) * (2 * mid + 1)
        apples = 2 * mid * (mid + 1) * (2 * mid + 1)
        if apples >= neededApples:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    # Perimeter = 8 * n
    return left * 8
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(log N), where N is the answer for layer n. This is because binary search runs in logarithmic time relative to the numeric answer (not input size). The computation per step is O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — uses only a constant number of variables; no recursion, no extra data structures.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If the garden was a **circle**, not a square, how would you compute the minimum radius to collect enough apples?  
  *Hint: Try to derive a similar area summation formula and use binary search on radius.*

- If each cell produced apples following a **different pattern**, e.g., apples at (x, y) = x\*y, could you adapt the approach?  
  *Hint: Try to derive a formula or must enumerate?*

- How would you handle multiple **tree origins** (garden not centered at a single (0,0)), all producing apples?  
  *Hint: Consider summing apples from all trees, and how overlap regions are handled.*

### Summary
This problem is an instance of **math simulation, greedy bounds, and binary search** for a minimum value. The key insight is deriving the summation formula for apples within a square of given layer, and using binary search to quickly find the smallest square side needed.  
This coding pattern (mathematical reduction to summation, then binary search for least/first occurrence) appears in problems involving accumulating totals, minimum thresholds, or exponential growth boundaries. Common in resource allocation and geometric covering problems.


### Flashcard
Binary search on side length k using closed-form formula 2k(k+1)(2k+1) for total apples in square of half-side k; return 8k when formula ≥ neededApples.
