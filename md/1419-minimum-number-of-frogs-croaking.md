### Leetcode 1419 (Medium): Minimum Number of Frogs Croaking [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-frogs-croaking)

### Description  
Given a string representing the sequence of sounds in overlapping frog croaks, where each croak must be the sequence: "c", "r", "o", "a", "k" in order. Multiple frogs can be croaking at the same time. Return the minimum number of frogs needed to produce the sound, or `-1` if the string is invalid.

### Examples  
**Example 1:**  
Input: `croakOfFrogs = "croakcroak"`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: One frog can repeat. Each "croak" is complete and not overlapping.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `croakOfFrogs = "crcoakroak"`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Two frogs needed as two croak sequences overlap.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `croakOfFrogs = "croakcrook"`  
Output: `-1`  
*Explanation: Invalid sequence, 'k' is missing, or order broken.*


### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- Each croak must follow the order: c→r→o→a→k. We need to ensure this order and count frogs.
- Track the number of frogs currently at each step using an array counter for c,r,o,a. Each new 'c' increases in progress, each new 'k' means a croak completes.
- At each char, ensure that we never have more of the next letter than of the previous; if so, invalid.
- At every 'c', possibly a new frog starts croaking; the maximum number of concurrent frogs in progress is our answer.
- At the end, all counters except the completed croak ('k') must be zero, or the string is invalid.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Characters not in "croak"
- String ends with incomplete croak
- Empty string
- Overlap too many times, more than number of frogs
- Out-of-order sequences

### Solution

```python
def minNumberOfFrogs(croakOfFrogs):
    order = 'croak'
    count = [0]*5 # for c,r,o,a,k
    max_frogs = frogs = 0
    index = {c:i for i,c in enumerate(order)}
    for ch in croakOfFrogs:
        i = index.get(ch, -1)
        if i == -1:
            return -1 # invalid char
        if i != 0 and count[i-1]==0:
            return -1 # previous char missing
        count[i] += 1
        if i != 0:
            count[i-1] -= 1
        if ch == 'c':
            frogs += 1
            max_frogs = max(max_frogs, frogs)
        if ch == 'k':
            frogs -= 1
    if any(count[:-1]):
        return -1 # incomplete croaks
    return max_frogs
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is string length. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since only 5 counters are used regardless of N.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  
- How would you handle a larger set of animal call patterns, each with their own sequence?  
  *Hint: Can you generalize the solution?*
- How could you handle streaming input efficiently?  
  *Hint: Process without knowing the total length in advance.*
- What if some croaks are allowed to be missing characters, how would you handle?  
  *Hint: Check each incomplete croak at the end.*

### Summary
The problem is solved using a greedy counting approach, updating stage counters for each croak sound. This exact method is common for sequence validation and concurrency management, applicable to event sequencing and resource management problems.
