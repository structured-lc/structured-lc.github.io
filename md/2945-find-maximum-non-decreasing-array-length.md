### Leetcode 2945 (Hard): Find Maximum Non-decreasing Array Length [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-maximum-non-decreasing-array-length)

### Description  
Given a 0-indexed integer array **nums**, you can perform any number of operations. In each operation, you select any contiguous subarray and replace it with the sum of its elements (effectively reducing part of the array, potentially shrinking its length).  
Return the **maximum length of a non-decreasing array** you can achieve after any number of these operations.  
A non-decreasing array means every subsequent number is **≥** the previous.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [4,3,2,6]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Merge [3,2] ⇒ array is [4,5,6]. This is non-decreasing and length 3.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [5,2,2]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Any possible merges eventually become a single element array. Maximum non-decreasing array length is 1.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [1,3,5,6]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: The original array is already non-decreasing. No need to merge. Output is 4.*  

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force:**  
  - Try every possible set of merges for every possible subarray and check for the longest non-decreasing array.  
  - Quickly becomes infeasible for large arrays due to exponential possibilities and the costly "merge" operation.

- **Optimization Ideas:**  
  - Notice that merging can *turn several decreasing elements into their sum* (possibly a bigger element), and *shorten the array*.
  - Aim to minimize the number of merges so the remaining array is non-decreasing **from left to right**.
  - Dynamic Programming approach:  
    - Let `dp[i]` be the minimal suffix sum ending at index `i` such that the sequence is non-decreasing from position 0 to `i`.
    - Try to greedily merge the smallest number of left elements where merging is necessary.
    - For each index, either extend from the previous partition or start a new partition by merging everything from some previous index up to current to satisfy non-decreasing order.
  - Prefix sum and binary search can be helpful for quickly finding possible merge locations.
  - The final answer is the **maximum number of partitions** (i.e., length) where each partition's sum is ≥ the previous.

- **Trade-offs:**  
  - The DP + prefix sums + binary search approach yields O(n log n) time, significantly better than brute-force.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Array is already non-decreasing.  
- All elements are the same.  
- Strictly decreasing input.
- Contains negative numbers.
- Only one element.
- Empty array (if allowed by problem statement—usually not).

### Solution

```python
def findMaximumLength(nums):
    # The idea is: partition nums into k (max possible) non-overlapping subarrays where
    # replacing each with its sum, the sequence is non-decreasing.

    n = len(nums)
    # prefix sums
    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + nums[i]

    # dp[i]: minimum possible last_sum if we can partition first i elements into k non-decreasing sums
    import bisect
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = -float('inf')  # before any element, last sum is -inf

    for parts in range(1, n + 1):
        # For each possible number of partitions (parts), check if can partition nums into parts non-decreasing segments
        prev = [-float('inf')]  # holds list of last sums so far
        for i in range(parts, n + 1):
            # Binary search for previous partition point j: prefix[j]
            # Partition [j, i) as one segment
            found = False
            for j in range(parts - 1, i):
                segment_sum = prefix[i] - prefix[j]
                # last sum in dp[j]
                if dp[j] <= segment_sum:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], segment_sum)
                    found = True
            if not found:
                dp[i] = float('inf')
        # If dp[n] is not inf, we found possible split in 'parts' pieces
        if dp[n] != float('inf'):
            return parts  # maximum possible length

    return 1  # fallback: can always merge everything

```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²). For each possible partition count, we try every j for partitioning. Can be optimized to O(n log n) with binary search and prefix sum tricks.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for prefix sum and DP arrays.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you could **only merge subarrays of a fixed minimum length**?  
  *Hint: Force merges to cover more than just one element at a time.*

- Can you modify the solution to **output the actual sequence** achieving the maximal non-decreasing array?  
  *Hint: Keep track of partition positions along with the DP.*

- What if the merge operation was costed, and you wished to **minimize total merge cost** ?  
  *Hint: Classical DP cost-minimization, weights are cost to sum a subarray.*

### Summary
This problem is a variant of **array partitioning with monotonic constraints** and greedy DP. The key is modeling each segment as a single sum and maximizing the number of non-decreasing partitions.  
Similar patterns appear in:
- Partition DP (subarray segmentation)
- **Greedy partitions for monotonic sequences**
- Can be used in resource allocation, file merging, or pattern design where contiguous regrouping is permitted under a monotonic/constraint.
