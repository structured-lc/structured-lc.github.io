### Leetcode 2358 (Medium): Maximum Number of Groups Entering a Competition [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-groups-entering-a-competition)

### Description  
Given an array of student grades, you need to split students into the maximum number of groups possible for a competition. Each group must have more students than the previous group, and the total grade sum of each group must be strictly greater than the previous group's sum. The goal is to find how many groups can be formed according to these rules.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `grades = [10, 6, 12, 7, 3, 5]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: You can form 3 groups like [3], [5, 6], [7, 10, 12]. These groups have increasing sizes (1, 2, 3) and increasing sums (3, 11, 29).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `grades = [8, 8, 8, 8]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: You can form 2 groups: , [8, 8, 8]. The sums are 8 and 24; the sizes are 1 and 3. (Can't form three groups since 1+2+3 > 4.)*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `grades = [1]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Only one student, so only one group can be formed.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, let's restate: we want the *maximum* groups, such that both the number of students and the sum in each group is strictly increasing.

A brute-force way would be to try all possible groupings, but that would be very inefficient.

Notice, however, that the **actual values of grades do not matter** for maximizing the number of groups—we just need to decide how many groups we can make by partitioning the students into groups of strictly increasing size.

The question becomes: for n students, what's the largest k such that **1 + 2 + … + k ≤ n**?  
This is the maximal number of complete groups, where the iᵗʰ group has i students.

This is a classic "sum of first k positive integers" problem:
- The sum is k(k+1)/2 ≤ n.
- So just find the biggest k such that k(k+1)/2 ≤ n.

We can solve for k using a loop, or even binary search since the sequence increases rapidly.

**Optimize:**  
- No need to sort the input; just use the length of the array.

### Corner cases to consider  
- grades is empty (`[]`): return 0.
- grades has only 1 element: return 1.
- n is a triangular number (e.g., n=6, k=3: 1+2+3=6).
- n not a triangular number, remainder should be ignored.
- All elements are equal (doesn't matter, still depends on n).
- Very large n: integer overflow (but solution is O(1), no matter how big n is).

### Solution

```python
def maximumGroups(grades):
    n = len(grades)
    k = 0
    # sum_so_far will be k₁ + k₂ + ... + kᵢ (group sizes)
    sum_so_far = 0
    # Increment group size by 1 until sum_so_far exceeds n
    while sum_so_far + k + 1 <= n:
        k += 1
        sum_so_far += k
    return k
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) — Because the sum grows quadratically, k is at most about √n; n is up to 10⁵, so this loop is extremely fast, but an even faster O(1) method can be used with math (quadratic formula). For interviews, the above loop is perfectly fine.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — Only a few integer variables for counters, no extra storage dependent on input size.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would your solution change if you had to output the actual groups (indices of students in each group)?
  *Hint: Do the grouping sequentially after computing k, by splitting the array in increasing sizes.*

- What if group sums must only be non-decreasing (not strictly increasing)?
  *Hint: Would this allow more groups? Any changes if all grades are equal?*

- Could you generalize this to custom group size constraints, for example, group sizes grow by 2 instead of 1 each time?
  *Hint: Use an arithmetic progression instead of 1,2,3,... increments.*

### Summary
This problem boils down to finding the largest k such that 1 + 2 + ... + k ≤ n, which is a triangular number bound. It’s a "greedy grouping" pattern that appears in many partition/greedy sum problems—a classic interview topic that tests insight into number summations and translation of a seemingly complex grouping problem to a simple numeric formula.


### Flashcard
Maximum groups equals the largest integer m where m × (m+1)/2 ≤ n (the total number of students).
