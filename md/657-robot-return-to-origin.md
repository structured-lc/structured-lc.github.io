### Leetcode 657 (Easy): Robot Return to Origin [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-return-to-origin)

### Description
The problem involves determining whether a robot, starting from the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane, returns to its starting point after executing a series of moves. The moves are represented by a string where 'R' denotes moving right, 'L' denotes moving left, 'U' denotes moving up, and 'D' denotes moving down.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: `moves = "UD"`  
Output: `True`  
Explanation: The robot moves up and then down, ending at the origin.

**Example 2:**
Input: `moves = "LL"`  
Output: `False`  
Explanation: After two left moves, the robot does not return to the origin.

**Example 3:**
Input: `moves = "RRDD"`  
Output: `False`  
Explanation: The robot moves right twice and then down twice, not returning to the origin.

### Thought Process
First, consider a brute-force approach by simulating each move on a 2D grid. However, this can be optimized by tracking the net movement in the x and y directions. The robot returns to the origin if the total number of 'R' moves equals the total number of 'L' moves and the total number of 'U' moves equals the total number of 'D' moves.

### Corner cases to consider
- **Empty string**: If the input string is empty, the robot does not move, so it returns to the origin.
- **Single move**: If the input contains a single move (e.g., 'R'), the robot will not return to the origin.
- **Balanced moves**: If the input contains an equal number of opposing moves (e.g., 'RRLL'), the robot will return to the origin.

### Solution

```python
def judgeCircle(moves: str) -> bool:
    # Initialize counters for vertical and horizontal moves
    vertical = 0  # Tracks 'U' and 'D' moves
    horizontal = 0  # Tracks 'R' and 'L' moves

    # Loop through each move in the input string
    for move in moves:
        # Update the counters based on the move direction
        if move == 'U':
            vertical += 1
        elif move == 'D':
            vertical -= 1
        elif move == 'R':
            horizontal += 1
        elif move == 'L':
            horizontal -= 1

    # Return True if the robot returns to the origin; False otherwise
    return vertical == 0 and horizontal == 0
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of moves in the input string, as we iterate through each move once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the counters for vertical and horizontal moves.

### Potential follow-up questions

1. **How would you handle this problem if the robot could move diagonally?**  
   *Hint: Consider how diagonal moves affect the x and y coordinates.*

2. **If the robot could only move in one direction, how would you determine if it returns to the origin?**  
   *Hint: Think about the implications of only having one type of move.*

3. **If the moves were represented as a series of integers where 0 = 'R', 1 = 'L', 2 = 'U', and 3 = 'D', how would you modify your solution?**  
   *Hint: You would need to modify how you update the move counters based on the integer values.*

### Summary
This problem uses a simple yet effective approach to track movement on a grid by balancing opposing moves. The pattern of counting opposing operations is common and can be applied to similar problems involving balancing or symmetry.
