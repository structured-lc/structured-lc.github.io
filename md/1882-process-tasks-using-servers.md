### Leetcode 1882 (Medium): Process Tasks Using Servers [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/process-tasks-using-servers)

### Description  
Given a list of **servers** with associated weights, and a list of **tasks** where the iᵗʰ task arrives at time i and takes tasks[i] seconds to process:  
- Each server can only process one task at a time.  
- When assigning a task:
  - Prefer the **available** server with the smallest weight. If weights tie, choose the smaller index.
  - If no server is available, the task waits until a server becomes free—then assign using the same rule (minimal weight/index).
  - Tasks are always handled in arrival order.
Return a list, where result[i] is the index of the server that processes the iᵗʰ task. The output tells, for each task, to which server it was assigned.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `servers = [3,3,2]`, `tasks = [1,2,3,2,1,2]`  
Output: `[2,2,0,2,1,2]`  
*Explanation:*
- At time 0: Task 0 arrives (cost=1). Servers 0,1,2 are all idle; pick weight=2 (server 2).
- At time 1: Task 1 arrives (cost=2). Servers 0,1 idle; pick weight=3, idx=0.
- At time 2: Task 2 arrives (cost=3). Servers 1 idle; pick it (idx=1).
- At time 2, server 2 finishes task 0 and becomes available, but task 2 already assigned to server 1.
- At time 3: Task 3 arrives (cost=2). Server 2 is free (from task 0), assign to it.
- Similarly for subsequent tasks as servers become free.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `servers = [5,1,4,3,2]`, `tasks = [2,1,2,4,5,2,1]`  
Output: `[1,4,1,4,1,3,2]`  
*Explanation:*
- Assign each task to the earliest available preferred server (by weight/index), following the rules above.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `servers = [10, 5]`, `tasks = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`  
Output: `[1,1,0,1,0]`  
*Explanation:*
- At time 0: Both servers idle, so pick server 1 (weight 5) for task 0.
- As tasks finish, assign based on earliest availability and min weight/index among available servers.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, simulate the task assignment over time.  
- Brute-force: At each second, iterate through all servers to check which are available, and assign the next task from the queue. This works but is slow, especially when both servers and tasks are large.  
- To optimize:
  - Use a **min-heap** for available servers (sorted by weight,index).  
  - Use another **min-heap** for busy servers, prioritized by finish time (tracked as (free_time, weight, index)).
  - For each arriving task:
    1. Release all servers from busy-heap whose busy_until ≤ current time (move back to idle-heap).
    2. If any servers are idle, assign task to the best one per rules, and update its busy_until.
    3. If no servers are idle, advance current time to soonest busy_until, assign next job accordingly.
- This ensures O(log n) time per task for heap operations.

Heap state diagrams or trace tables/diaries are very helpful when explaining this to an interviewer.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All servers have same weight (verify ties broken by index).
- Only one server or only one task.
- Tasks times much larger than server count — queue grows.
- Large gaps between server availability and task arrival.
- Tasks that can all be handled immediately, i.e., enough servers.
- Tasks all have the same cost.
- Tasks that arrive after large time gaps (simulate continued processing).

### Solution

```python
import heapq

def assignTasks(servers, tasks):
    # idle_servers stores (weight, index)
    idle_servers = []
    for idx, w in enumerate(servers):
        heapq.heappush(idle_servers, (w, idx))

    # busy_servers stores (free_time, weight, index)
    busy_servers = []
    res = []
    time = 0

    for i, cost in enumerate(tasks):
        time = max(time, i)
        # Release all servers that become free by now
        while busy_servers and busy_servers[0][0] <= time:
            _, w, idx = heapq.heappop(busy_servers)
            heapq.heappush(idle_servers, (w, idx))
        # If idle_servers empty, fast-forward time
        if not idle_servers:
            time = busy_servers[0][0]
            while busy_servers and busy_servers[0][0] <= time:
                _, w, idx = heapq.heappop(busy_servers)
                heapq.heappush(idle_servers, (w, idx))
        # Now assign task
        w, idx = heapq.heappop(idle_servers)
        res.append(idx)
        heapq.heappush(busy_servers, (time + cost, w, idx))
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O((n + m) × log n), where n = number of servers, m = number of tasks. All heap operations (push/pop) are log n. There are O(m) task assignments and up to O(m) server return-to-idle events.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m), for heaps (servers + currently busy jobs) and output array.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If task durations are extremely large and there is only one server—can you optimize further?  
  *Hint: Simulate using a simple queue, not a heap, if only one server.*

- If tasks can arrive at arbitrary times, not just at i seconds?  
  *Hint: Track arrival times in a priority queue for tasks.*

- What if the number of servers is huge, but most are always busy? How to avoid unnecessary heap insertions?  
  *Hint: Only insert and pop servers as they become idle/busy, to minimize heap churning.*

### Summary
This problem uses the **two-heap** simulation pattern: one min-heap for selecting the next available/idle server (by weight/index), and another min-heap to track when busy servers become available again (by free_time). This pattern is very common when you need optimal resource allocation with ordering constraints and can also apply to problems about bandwidth, parallel job scheduling, and real-time control. Key insight: Use min-heaps to efficiently handle dynamic assignment and release ordering.
