### Leetcode 2111 (Hard): Minimum Operations to Make the Array K-Increasing [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-array-k-increasing)

### Description  
You are given an array of n positive integers, `arr`, and an integer `k`. An array is K-increasing if for every index i (k ≤ i < n), `arr[i-k] ≤ arr[i]` holds. In other words, each element must be at least as large as the element k positions before it. You can change any element of the array to any positive integer in one operation. Find the minimum number of operations needed to make `arr` K-increasing.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: For k=1, the array needs to be non-decreasing. We must change the last 4 elements to match or exceed the previous ones: [5,5,5,5,5].*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Split into 2 groups: [4,5,6] (indices 0,2,4) and [1,2,2] (indices 1,3,5). Each group must be non-decreasing. The first group needs 1 change (1 operation), the second also 1. 1+1=2.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `arr = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1], k = 2`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Groups: [1,1,1,1] (indices 0,2,4,6) and [2,2,2] (indices 1,3,5). We need to modify 3 values in the first group to make it non-decreasing.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, brute force: Try all possible combinations of replacements to make the array K-increasing. But this is exponential and clearly infeasible.

Observation:  
A K-increasing array, when grouped by mod k, forms k independent subsequences, each of which must be non-decreasing. For each group formed by indices i, i+k, i+2k, ..., we must make that subsequence non-decreasing with the MINIMUM operations.

For a single sequence, the minimum number of replacements to make it non-decreasing = length of the sequence − length of its Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence (LNDS).  
So, for each group, compute its LNDS and sum up changes required.

As for trade-offs:  
- Instead of brute-force, this approach leverages LIS/LNDS computation, giving a much faster solution.
- Binary search is used to find LNDS efficiently for each group.

### Corner cases to consider  
- k = 1 (whole array must be non-decreasing)
- k ≥ n (no constraints, needs 0 operations)
- Array with all equal elements (needs 0 operations)
- Array of length 1 (needs 0 operations)
- Multiple groups may need no changes

### Solution

```python
def kIncreasing(arr, k):
    # Helper: Computes length of Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence using binary search
    def lnds_length(nums):
        seq = []
        for x in nums:
            # For non-decreasing, use upper_bound
            left, right = 0, len(seq)
            while left < right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2
                if seq[mid] <= x:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid
            if left == len(seq):
                seq.append(x)
            else:
                seq[left] = x
        return len(seq)
    
    n = len(arr)
    ops = 0
    for start in range(k):
        # Collect the group (start, start+k, ...)
        group = []
        idx = start
        while idx < n:
            group.append(arr[idx])
            idx += k
        # Compute the number of operations for this group
        lnds = lnds_length(group)
        ops += len(group) - lnds
    return ops
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log(n/k))
    - There are k groups. For each group of ⌊n/k⌋ elements, LNDS is computed in O(m log m) where m ≈ n/k, so total is O(k × (n/k) log(n/k)) = O(n log(n/k)).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n/k)
    - For each group, an extra array (at most size ⌊n/k⌋) is needed. Overall auxiliary space is O(n/k).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the allowed operation is only changes to adjacent elements?
  *Hint: Think about dynamic programming with local moves.*

- Can you output one possible valid resulting K-increasing array, not just the minimum number of operations?
  *Hint: Track the LNDS path, reconstruct the sequence, replace other elements.*

- What if the cost to change an element is not uniform, but given per element?
  *Hint: Try to incorporate the change cost in the DP when solving for LNDS.*

### Summary
This problem is a variation of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) but across k independent subsequences. The technique of splitting the problem into groups based on mod k and using efficient binary search-based LNDS is crucial. This grouping/LIS pattern is common in problems where multiple crossing subsequences must all be partially ordered, such as in Leetcode 1671 or 2407. Use this approach whenever you need to break array by cyclic subgroups and optimize monotonicity within each.


### Flashcard
Split array into k groups by index mod k; for each, compute minimal replacements as group length minus length of its longest non-decreasing subsequence.
