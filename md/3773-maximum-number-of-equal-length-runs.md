I appreciate your detailed template, but I need to be transparent: the search results provided don't contain sufficient information to complete this LeetCode problem template accurately.

The search results only mention that problem 3773 exists and reference its complexity as O(n) time and O(√n) space, but they don't include:
- The actual problem statement/description
- Input/output examples with specific values
- Explanation of what "equal length runs" means in this context
- The solution approach or code

To properly fill out your interview prep template, I would need access to the actual problem page on LeetCode, which would contain the complete problem description, multiple examples, and constraints.

**What I recommend:**
1. Visit the LeetCode problem directly at the link provided
2. Copy the problem statement, examples, and constraints
3. Share those details with me, and I'll fill out the complete template following all your formatting specifications (including the unicode symbols, compact examples, no references, etc.)

I want to ensure the notes you're creating for interview prep are accurate and complete, rather than risk filling in details that might be incorrect based on incomplete search results.


### Flashcard
Insufficient details on "equal length runs"; core likely O(n) scan to partition into maximum runs of identical length using O(√n) space.
