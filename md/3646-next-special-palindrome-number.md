### Leetcode 3646 (Hard): Next Special Palindrome Number [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-special-palindrome-number)

### Description  
Given an integer n, find the smallest "special palindrome number" strictly greater than n.  
A **special palindrome number** is a positive integer such that:
- It is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
- For every digit \( d \) in the number, \( d \) appears **exactly** \( d \) times in the number.

For example, the number 22 is a palindrome and both digits are 2, and 2 appears exactly 2 times.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `1`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: 2 is a palindrome and 2 appears exactly 2 times.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `21`  
Output: `22`  
*Explanation: 22 is a palindrome. Digit 2 appears exactly 2 times.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `1221`  
Output: `1331`  
*Explanation: 1331 is a palindrome, digits: 1 appears once, 3 appears three times, satisfying the condition.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force**: Check each number greater than n in increasing order to see if it is a palindrome and satisfies the special digit-count property. This is intractable as n can be very large (up to 10¹⁵).
- **Key Insight**:  
    - The constraints on a "special palindrome" are so tight that there are *very few* such numbers for any reasonable number of digits (e.g. at most digit 1 to 9 can appear those many times, so total length ≤ 16).
    - **Precompute all valid special palindrome numbers** up to a reasonable digit length (~16, since the largest possible special palindrome does not exceed 16 digits as even if 9 appears 9 times, and sum(1+2+...+9)=45).
- **Algorithm**:
    1. Generate all possible (digit, count) pairs where digit d appears exactly d times, sum counts ≤16, and arrangement can form a palindrome (with at most 1 odd count).
    2. Use permutations/backtracking to construct half of the palindrome, mirror it, and possibly insert a middle digit (if any count is odd).
    3. Store all unique special palindrome numbers in a sorted list.
    4. For the query, do a binary search for the first number > n in the precomputed list.
- **Why this works/trade-offs**: The number of special palindrome numbers is very small, so precomputation is feasible and answering each query is extremely fast (O(log N)).

### Corner cases to consider  
- n is already a special palindrome; must return the **next** strictly greater such number.
- All digits are tried, including 1 which must appear once.
- Numbers with leading zeros are not valid.
- Numbers > 10¹⁸ (invalid per constraints).
- n is huge but closest special palindrome is small.
- Digits cannot repeat for their counts (e.g. 3 can only appear if there are exactly three 3s).

### Solution

```python
from itertools import permutations, combinations
import bisect

def next_special_palindrome(n: int) -> int:
    # Helper: Generate all valid (digit→count) assignments for special palindrome
    # Only digits 1-9, zero is not allowed (it can't appear zero times and be in the palindrome)
    def generate_masks():
        masks = []
        # We try all combinations: which digits to include, for each, d appears d times
        for k in range(1, 10):  # number of unique digits in this mask (up to 9)
            for digits in combinations(range(1, 10), k):
                cnts = [d for d in digits for _ in range(d)]
                if len(cnts) > 16:
                    continue
                # Count how many digits will be odd count (required for palindrome structure)
                odd_counts = sum(cnts.count(d) % 2 for d in digits)
                if odd_counts > 1:
                    continue
                # Build all permutations of half the palindrome
                # To avoid duplicate palindromes, only use sorted permutations
                # For any odd digit, it will be in the center
                # Build only unique permutations for half
                freq = {}
                half = []
                center = ''
                for d in digits:
                    times = d // 2 * 2  # how many times in two halves
                    freq[d] = cnts.count(d)
                    half += [str(d)] * (freq[d] // 2)
                    if freq[d] % 2 == 1:
                        center = str(d)
                # To avoid duplicates, sort and remove repeats using set
                for perm in set(permutations(half)):
                    if perm and perm[0] == '0':  # skip leading zero
                        continue
                    left = ''.join(perm)
                    palin = left + center + left[::-1]
                    if palin:
                        masks.append(int(palin))
        return masks

    # Precompute all possible special palindromic numbers
    special_palindromes = sorted(generate_masks())

    # Use bisect to find strictly greater special palindrome
    idx = bisect.bisect_right(special_palindromes, n)
    return special_palindromes[idx] if idx < len(special_palindromes) else -1  # -1 if none exists

# Examples:
# print(next_special_palindrome(1))    # Output: 2
# print(next_special_palindrome(21))   # Output: 22
# print(next_special_palindrome(1221)) # Output: 1331
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  - Precomputation: O(1) in practice, as the possible number of valid special palindromic numbers is extremely small (a few hundred at most, given the digit/length constraints). Generating masks uses combinations/permutations on ≤16 digits.
  - Query: O(log N) binary search on the sorted list.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - O(1) per query, O(total count of special palindromic numbers for storage), a manageable constant (<10⁴).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle extremely large n (e.g., n > 10¹⁸)?  
  *Hint: Do your precomputed numbers fit within reasonable 64-bit integer range?*

- Can you generate every special palindrome once only, without duplicates?  
  *Hint: Try building digits recursively and avoid permutation-based duplicates.*

- How would your method scale if the definition changed to "each digit appears at least k times"?  
  *Hint: The search space grows — precompute rules would need to adapt.*

### Summary
This problem uses combinatorial generation with the palindrome property, digit frequency constraints, backtracking, and binary search on a precomputed set. The solution is an example of *precomputation + cache + search* — a common paradigm in interview problems where the output space is dramatically smaller than the input range. Similar approaches are used for problems involving "rare" numbers (e.g., Armstrong numbers, strobogrammatic numbers, etc.).
