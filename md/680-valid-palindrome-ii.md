### Leetcode 680 (Easy): Valid Palindrome II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii)

### Description  
Given a string, determine if it can be a palindrome by removing at most one character.  
A **palindrome** reads the same forwards and backwards. If the string is already a palindrome or can become one by deleting just one character anywhere in the string, return True; otherwise, return False.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "aba"`  
Output: `True`  
*Explanation: The string "aba" is already a palindrome.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "abca"`  
Output: `True`  
*Explanation: Remove 'c' at index 2 → "aba", which is a palindrome.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = "abc"`  
Output: `False`  
*Explanation: Removing any one character ("ab", "bc", or "ac") does not produce a palindrome.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, check if the string is already a palindrome using the two-pointer technique: compare characters from the start and end, moving towards the center. If all pairs match, return True.

If you find a mismatch, you have one "deletion opportunity." Now, try removing either the left or right character of the mismatch, and check if either remaining substring is a palindrome:
- If either is a palindrome, return True.
- If neither works, return False.

The key idea is to avoid unnecessary repeated work: only perform the palindrome check twice at most after the first mismatch. This strategy is much more efficient than deleting every character, one by one, and checking all possible results.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty string: should return True.
- String of length 1: should return True.
- String is already a palindrome.
- All characters the same (e.g. "aaaaaa").
- Mismatch is at the start or the end of the string.
- No possible way to form a palindrome with only one removal.

### Solution

```python
def validPalindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    # Helper function to check if s[left:right+1] is a palindrome
    def is_palindrome(left: int, right: int) -> bool:
        while left < right:
            if s[left] != s[right]:
                return False
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        return True

    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            # Try skipping left character or right character
            return is_palindrome(left + 1, right) or is_palindrome(left, right - 1)
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  We may scan the string up to twice (once for the main loop, once for the substring palindrome check). Checking the substring after a mismatch takes O(n), but since this happens at most once, overall is O(n).

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  No extra space is used beyond constant pointers/variables. The function does not use extra arrays or recursion stack.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you are allowed to remove at most k characters?  
  *Hint: Try recursion or dynamic programming to generalize for k removals.*

- What if the string is very large and you need to handle it in a streaming fashion?  
  *Hint: Consider how to process or index substrings efficiently, or use rolling hash.*

- Can you do this in a way that returns the actual palindrome string (after removal), if possible?  
  *Hint: Keep track of which character you skipped, and reconstruct the string.*

### Summary
This problem uses the classic **two-pointer technique** for palindrome validation, with a controlled relaxation (removal of one character). This approach is common for string manipulation questions involving symmetry or mirroring, and applies to a variety of scenarios where at most one modification or "failure" is allowed. It's a useful strategy in both interviews and competitive programming.


### Flashcard
Use two pointers to check for palindrome; on mismatch, try skipping either side once and check if the substring is a palindrome.
