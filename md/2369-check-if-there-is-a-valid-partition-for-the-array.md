### Leetcode 2369 (Medium): Check if There is a Valid Partition For The Array [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-there-is-a-valid-partition-for-the-array)

### Description  
Given an integer array `nums`, partition it into one or more contiguous subarrays such that **every** subarray is _valid_, where a valid subarray is **exactly one** of:
- Contains **exactly 2 equal elements** (e.g., `[4, 4]`).
- Contains **exactly 3 equal elements** (e.g., `[3, 3, 3]`).
- Contains **exactly 3 consecutive increasing elements** (i.e., `nums[i+1] = nums[i]+1` and `nums[i+2] = nums[i]+2`; e.g., `[2,3,4]`).

Return `True` if such a partition exists for the entire array. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `[4,4,4,5,6]`  
Output: `True`  
*Explanation: Partition as `[4,4]` and `[4,5,6]`. Both are valid (first is 2 equal, second is 3 consecutive increasing).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `[1,1,1,2]`  
Output: `False`  
*Explanation: Possible partitions: `[1,1],[1,2]` (invalid `[1,2]`), or `[1,1,1],[2]` (invalid `[2]`). No valid way.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `[3,3,3,4,5,6]`  
Output: `True`  
*Explanation: Partition as `[3,3,3]` and `[4,5,6]` (first is 3 equal, second is 3 consecutive increasing).*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force:**  
  - Try all possible partitions by recursively splitting the array at every index.
  - At each split, check if left subarray is valid, then recur on right.
  - This is exponential: too slow for input size up to 10⁵.

- **Optimization: Dynamic Programming**
  - Let `dp[i]` be True if `nums[0:i]` (the subarray ending at i-1) can be partitioned validly.
  - **Transition:** For each i, check if last 2 or 3 elements form a valid block:
    - If i ≥ 2 and `nums[i-2:i]` (last 2) are equal AND `dp[i-2]` is True, set `dp[i]` = True.
    - If i ≥ 3, either:
      - `nums[i-3:i]` (last 3) are all equal AND `dp[i-3]` is True, OR
      - `nums[i-3:i]` is 3 consecutive increasing AND `dp[i-3]` is True.
  - This gives O(n) time and space.
  - **Why this approach:**  
    - Each position depends only on the previous 2 or 3 positions.
    - No need for recursion_stack; purely iterative with DP.

### Corner cases to consider  
- The array has fewer than 2 elements: always invalid.
- Arrays with length exactly 2 or 3: only valid if block type fits exactly.
- All elements same (e.g., `[9,9,9,9,9,9]`).
- Strictly increasing consecutive sequence.
- Mix of increasing and repeating numbers that don't fit partition lengths.
- Partition at beginning vs end (e.g., leading `[2,2,2]`, trailing `[1,2,3]`).
- Large arrays with no valid blocks: `[1,2,1,2,1,2...]`.

### Solution

```python
def validPartition(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    # dp[i] == True means nums[0:i] can be validly partitioned
    dp = [True] + [False] * n  # dp[0] = True (empty array)

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Case 1: Last 2 elements are equal
        if nums[i-1] == nums[i-2] and dp[i-2]:
            dp[i] = True
        
        # Case 2: Last 3 elements are equal
        if i >= 3 and nums[i-1] == nums[i-2] == nums[i-3] and dp[i-3]:
            dp[i] = True

        # Case 3: Last 3 elements consecutive increasing
        if i >= 3 and nums[i-3]+1 == nums[i-2] and nums[i-2]+1 == nums[i-1] and dp[i-3]:
            dp[i] = True

    return dp[n]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n).  
  For each index, perform a constant number of checks (max 3 conditions), for n indices.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n).  
  The DP array requires n+1 elements (can be reduced to O(1) with rolling variables since each step needs only last 3 dp values).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you reduce the **space usage** further?  
  *Hint: You only need to remember the last three dp states at each step.*

- How would you modify this if the **valid block sizes or rules change**?  
  *Hint: Make the block checking logic more generic; maybe take a function as parameter.*

- What if partitions can be **overlapping** or not required to be contiguous?  
  *Hint: Would DP structure change? Think about possible graph-reachability interpretation.*

### Summary
This is a classic **dynamic programming** problem on sequences/arrays, specifically for partitioning with block rules. The pattern is often called **DP with block states** and is the same as for many tiling or segmentation problems. Useful anywhere you need to check for segmenting an array into intervals of allowed “types,” such as number splitting, jump games, word breaks, and decoding messages.
