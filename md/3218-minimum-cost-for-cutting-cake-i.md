### Leetcode 3218 (Medium): Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-cutting-cake-i)

### Description  
Given an m × n cake that must be split into 1 × 1 squares, you are provided:
- `horizontalCut` (length m-1): cost of each horizontal cut
- `verticalCut` (length n-1): cost of each vertical cut

At every step, you may cut along any uncut horizontal or vertical line. Each cut splits a piece into two, with cost determined by the provided array.  
The cost of each cut *does not change* regardless of when you make it.  
Return the **minimum total cost** required to divide the entire cake into 1 × 1 pieces.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `m = 3, n = 3, horizontalCut = [2, 1], verticalCut = [3, 1]`  
Output: `12`  
*Explanation:  
- The optimal strategy: 
    1. Cut vertically with 3 (cost: 3). The cake is now in 1 × 3 and 2 × 3.
    2. Cut horizontally with 2 (cost: 2×2=4, since there are 2 vertical slices to cover). 
    3. Cut horizontally with 1 (cost: 1×2=2).
    4. Cut vertically with 1 (cost: 1×3=3, as now 3 horizontal strips).
    - Total: 3 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 12.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `m = 2, n = 2, horizontalCut = [1], verticalCut = [1]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation:  
- First cut either direction: cost = 1×1 = 1.  
- Second cut: cost = 1×2 = 2 (as there are 2 slices).  
- Third cut: cost = 1×2 = 2 (now the other orientation).
- Total: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `m = 4, n = 2, horizontalCut = [4, 1, 2], verticalCut = [5]`  
Output: `23`  
*Explanation:  
- Cut vertical at 5 first: cost = 5×1 = 5.  
- Next, for each of the 2 columns, three horizontal cuts: (4+1+2)×2 = 7×2 = 14.  
- Total: 5 + 14 = 19.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Naive brute-force**: Try all sequences of horizontal and vertical cuts; exponential time, clearly intractable beyond small size.
- **Insight**: Each time you make a horizontal cut, the number of current vertical partitions multiplies the cut cost (and vice versa). Since the cost per cut is fixed, making the most expensive cut as early as possible will maximize the number of partitions it affects, minimizing the cumulative sum.
- **Approach**:  
    - Sort both cuts descending.  
    - Use two pointers (one for `horizontalCut`, one for `verticalCut`).  
    - At each step, pick the largest available cut (greedy).  
    - Track current number of rows and columns (as cuts proceed, these values increase).  
    - For horizontal cuts, multiply cost by current `col_count`.  
    - For vertical cuts, multiply cost by current `row_count`.  
    - Continue until all cuts are done.
- **Why greedy**: By making the highest-cost cuts *early*, we ensure their multiplied effect is minimized in total sum; this is analogous to the "minimum cost to cut a board" classic greedy problem.

### Corner cases to consider  
- m or n is 1: no cuts needed, return 0.
- All costs zero: total cost is zero.
- All cuts are equal.
- Large input sizes: avoid O(N²) solutions.

### Solution

```python
def minimumCost(m, n, horizontalCut, verticalCut):
    # Sort cuts in descending order (greedy: use biggest first)
    horizontalCut.sort(reverse=True)
    verticalCut.sort(reverse=True)
    
    i = j = 0
    row_count = 1  # Starts with 1 continuous row
    col_count = 1  # Starts with 1 continuous column
    total = 0

    while i < len(horizontalCut) or j < len(verticalCut):
        # Pick the largest cut available
        if j >= len(verticalCut) or (i < len(horizontalCut) and horizontalCut[i] >= verticalCut[j]):
            # Do horizontal cut: increases number of rows
            total += horizontalCut[i] * col_count
            row_count += 1
            i += 1
        else:
            # Do vertical cut: increases number of columns
            total += verticalCut[j] * row_count
            col_count += 1
            j += 1
    return total
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(m log m + n log n)  
  (dominated by sorting `horizontalCut` and `verticalCut`)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra (excluding input arrays after sorting), only variables and pointers are used.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if each cut’s cost depends on the current size of the piece being cut rather than being fixed?
  *Hint: Now dynamic programming may be required, since the cost is not fixed.*

- How would you handle very large inputs if you could not sort in memory?
  *Hint: You might use external sorting, or incremental selection of the max cut.*

- Could you return the exact sequence of cuts made to achieve the minimum cost?
  *Hint: Keep track of the cut order and the region being divided at each step.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic greedy cut-order optimization: always make the highest-cost cut first to minimize its multiplication across future pieces. The solution uses **sorting and two-pointer greedy traversal** — a frequent pattern in interval and cost-minimization problems. This pattern often applies to "cutting", "merge", or "divide and conquer" types of cost aggregation questions.
