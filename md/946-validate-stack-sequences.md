### Leetcode 946 (Medium): Validate Stack Sequences [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences)

### Description  
Given two integer arrays **pushed** and **popped**, both representing sequences of distinct values, determine if the sequence in **popped** could be the result of a series of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack using the values in **pushed** in order.  
You may only **push** in the order elements appear in **pushed**, and you may **pop** off the stack at any time, but the **popped** sequence must be reproduced.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `pushed = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `popped = [4,5,3,2,1]`  
Output: `True`  
*Explanation: Push 1,2,3,4. Pop 4, push 5, pop 5, pop 3, pop 2, pop 1. All match popped sequence in order.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `pushed = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `popped = [4,3,5,1,2]`  
Output: `False`  
*Explanation: Push 1,2,3,4. Pop 4, pop 3, push 5, pop 5. Next expected is 1 in stack, but 1 is beneath 2, cannot pop in this order.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `pushed = [2,1,0]`, `popped = [1,2,0]`  
Output: `True`  
*Explanation: Push 2,1. Pop 1, pop 2, push 0, pop 0. All match popped sequence.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute Force:**  
  Simulate all possible push/pop sequences, but that's factorial in complexity—too slow for medium/large inputs.

- **Optimized Simulation:**  
  Use a stack and simulate the process:
    - For each number in **pushed**, push it onto the stack.
    - While the stack's top matches the current number in **popped**, pop it and advance the popped index.
    - If at the end, popped index equals the length of **pushed**, it's valid. Otherwise, it isn't.
  - This approach is O(n) time and O(n) space, with each number being pushed and popped at most once[1][2][4].
  - We can further optimize, but this solution is simple and efficient for interview purposes.

- **Final approach:**  
  The stack simulation is easy to understand, easy to code, and gives correct results for all cases while handling edge cases gracefully.

### Corner cases to consider  
- **Empty arrays**: Both pushed and popped are empty → return True.
- **Single element**: pushed = [x], popped = [x] → should return True.
- **All pops before pushing all**: popped = pushed[::-1] → should return True.
- **Impossible pop order**: popped order violates stack LIFO order.
- **Non-matching lengths**: Input guarantees same length, but good to assert in code for robustness.
- **Elements present in one array and not the other**: Input guarantees both arrays are permutations of each other.
- **Immediate pop after push**: e.g., pushed = [1,2,3], popped = [1,2,3].

### Solution

```python
def validateStackSequences(pushed, popped):
    # Stack to simulate the actual process
    stack = []
    pop_idx = 0
    for value in pushed:
        # Push each value onto the stack
        stack.append(value)
        # Pop from stack if it matches the next expected popped value
        while stack and stack[-1] == popped[pop_idx]:
            stack.pop()
            pop_idx += 1
    # If we've matched all the popped elements, it's valid
    return pop_idx == len(pushed)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of pushed/popped.  
  Each element is pushed and potentially popped only once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the stack, in the worst case (strictly increasing sequences).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If we had to record the sequence of operations (push/pop), how would we do it?  
  *Hint: Maintain a log alongside the stack simulation.*

- Can you solve this with O(1) extra space?  
  *Hint: Reuse the input arrays, overwrite as you simulate the stack.*

- What if elements were not guaranteed to be distinct?  
  *Hint: Consider how duplicates affect tracking the pop operations and indices.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic application of **stack simulation** for LIFO sequences. The approach directly models the real stack operations and is a good example of **two-pointer** and **stack-pointer** coding patterns. It is relevant in parsing, compiler/interpreter design, validating orderings, and simulating machine execution. The optimized O(n) time and space stack solution is standard in problems involving matching sequences with stack properties.


### Flashcard
Simulate stack—push from pushed, pop when top matches popped; valid if all pops succeed in order.
