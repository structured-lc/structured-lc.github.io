### Leetcode 3029 (Medium): Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-revert-word-to-initial-state-i)

### Description  
You are given a string **word** and an integer **k**.  
Every second, you remove the first **k** characters from **word** and append them to the end, preserving their order.  
Your task: Find the minimum number of seconds (> 0) required for the word to become the same as its initial state.

Think of this operation as a *cyclic left rotation by k*. The answer is the minimum time (> 0) until the string returns to its original configuration.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `word = "abacaba", k = 3`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:*
- 1st second: remove "aba" → `"cababa" + "aba"` → `"cababac"`
- 2nd second: remove "cab" → `"abac" + "cab"` → `"abacaba"` (matches the initial)
- So, answer is 2.


**Example 2:**  
Input: `word = "abacaba", k = 4`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation:*
- 1st second: remove "abac" → `"aba" + "abac"` → `"abacaba"` (matches the initial)
- So, answer is 1.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `word = "abcbabcd", k = 2`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation:*
- 1st: "ab" → "cbabcd" + "ab" = "cbabcdab"  
- 2nd: "cb" → "abcdab" + "cb" = "abcdabcb"  
- 3rd: "ab" → "cdabcb" + "ab" = "cdabcbab"  
- 4th: "cd" → "abcbab" + "cd" = "abcbabcd" (original)
- So, answer is 4.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

First, I’d simulate the process, rotating **word** by k each second, until the word returns to its initial state.  
But this brute-force approach is O(n²) in the worst case, since for long strings and poor choices of k, we might repeat many times.

Next, observe that this process is a rotation: moving the first k letters to the end. So, after t steps, the word will be rotated left by (k×t) positions.  
We need to find the smallest t > 0 such that the word returns to the same as the original.

Rotating left by (k×t) positions means that:
- The word after t steps = original word if and only if (k×t) mod len(word) == 0, and the substrings align.

But, a more efficient way: For each multiple of k (i = k, 2k, 3k, ..., < n), check if word[i:] + word[:i] == word.  
- The minimum t > 0 such that rotating left by i = k×t brings word back to itself.

Alternatively, check for i in steps of k:  
- If word[i:] == word[:-i], then after i/k steps, it is restored.

If not, the process will always restore after ⌈n/k⌉ steps, after all characters have been cycled.


### Corner cases to consider  
- k = word.length (rotation is by full string)
- k = 1 (cycles every character one by one)
- All characters the same
- k does not divide word.length
- k divides word.length exactly
- Short strings (length 1 or 2)
- Palindrome strings vs. non-palindrome strings

### Solution

```python
def minimumTimeToInitialState(word: str, k: int) -> int:
    n = len(word)
    
    # Try rotations in multiples of k
    for i in range(k, n, k):
        # If rotated word matches original
        if word[i:] + word[:i] == word:
            return i // k
    # If no earlier match, minimum steps to "rotate" all characters
    return (n + k - 1) // k  # Equivalent to ⌈n/k⌉
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n). For each possible rotation (max n/k ≈ n), comparing substrings (each up to n), but thanks to slicing optimization and limited k, this is acceptable for small n (constraint n ≤ 50).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n). Used for substring slices.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the word length can be up to 10⁵?
  *Hint: Can you optimize substring comparison? Use KMP or Z-array for string matching.*

- What if we want to actually generate the sequence of intermediate words?
  *Hint: Track and store each rotation.*

- What if the characters of the word can be changed in some steps (robustness to noise)?
  *Hint: Think about edit distance or tolerance of mismatches.*

### Summary
This is a classic **string rotation**/simulation problem, optimized by recognizing periodicity. The approach here is related to checking for the order of a rotation operation, and appears in many cycle-detection and periodicity string questions.  
Patterns: **Simulation**, **String Matching**, **Rotation**, **Cyclic pattern detection**.  
Such techniques generalize to cycle problems, or modular arithmetic in array/string rotations.
