### Leetcode 1310 (Medium): XOR Queries of a Subarray [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/xor-queries-of-a-subarray)

### Description  
Given an integer array arr and a list of queries, each query being a pair of indices [left_i, right_i], return an array where each entry is the XOR (exclusive OR) of elements in arr from left_i to right_i, inclusive.

### Examples  
**Example 1:**  
Input: `arr = [1,3,4,8], queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3],[3,3]]`  
Output: `[2, 7, 14, 8]`  
*Explanation: [1^3=2, 3^4=7, 1^3^4^8=14, 8=8]*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `arr = [4,8,2,10], queries = [[2,3],[1,3],[0,0],[0,3]]`  
Output: `[8, 0, 4, 4]`  
*Explanation: [2^10=8, 8^2^10=0, 4=4, 4^8^2^10=4]*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `arr = [2,4,7,3], queries = [[0,1],[1,3],[0,2]]`  
Output: `[6, 0, 1]`  
*Explanation: [2^4=6, 4^7^3=0, 2^4^7=1]*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
The brute-force approach is to compute the XOR in each query's range directly, which is O(q×n). But XOR has a prefix property: if prefix[i] is XOR of arr[0..i], then XOR of arr[l..r] is prefix[r] if l==0, otherwise prefix[r] ^ prefix[l-1]. So, I would first compute prefix XOR for arr (O(n)), then answer each query in O(1) using this property. This reduces total time to O(n + q).

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty arr or queries.
- Queries with l==r (single element).
- Queries where l==0 (careful with prefix[-1]).
- Non-overlapping, overlapping, or repeated queries.
- arr with all equal numbers or with all zeros.

### Solution

```python
def xorQueries(arr, queries):
    # Compute prefix XOR
    prefix = [0]*(len(arr)+1)  # prefix[0]=0, prefix[1]=arr[0], ...
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] ^ arr[i]
    # Answer queries
    return [prefix[r+1] ^ prefix[l] for l, r in queries]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n + q), where n=len(arr), q=len(queries). Computing prefix in O(n), queries in O(q).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), storing prefix array.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  
- How to extend if updates to arr happen between queries?  
  *Hint: Need a segment tree for fast updates and queries.*

- What if queries arrive online (before all are known)?  
  *Hint: Still just maintain prefix, but if arr is fixed, O(1) per query.*

- If given many queries and big arr, can we parallelize?  
  *Hint: Prefix XOR in parallel with scan algorithms; split queries among threads.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic use of prefix XOR array—a common coding pattern for subarray range queries involving XOR. The pattern can be similarly used for sum or other associative operations, and is foundational for range-aggregation problems.
