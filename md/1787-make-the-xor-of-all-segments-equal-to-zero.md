### Leetcode 1787 (Hard): Make the XOR of All Segments Equal to Zero [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-the-xor-of-all-segments-equal-to-zero)

### Description  
We are given an array of integers, nums, and an integer k. The XOR of a segment `[left, right]` (left ≤ right) is defined as `nums[left] ⊕ nums[left+1] ⊕ ... ⊕ nums[right]` (where ⊕ is bitwise XOR).  
We must **change as few elements as possible** in nums, so that **every segment of consecutive k elements has XOR = 0**. Return the minimum number of changes needed.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,0,3,0]`, `k = 1`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: We need to change each element to 0 for every (single) segment's XOR to be zero. For example, change to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Three numbers differ from the original.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [3,4,5,2,1,7,3,4,7]`, `k = 3`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: There are 3 groups by index mod 3. We can change three elements to get [3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 7], so every segment of length 3 has XOR = 0.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,4,1,2,5,1,2,6]`, `k = 3`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Change three elements to get [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3]. All possible k-length segments (by mod class) have XOR = 0.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute-force:**  
  We could try *all* possible changes for every k-length segment, but with up to 2000 elements and overlapping segments, this quickly becomes infeasible (exponential time).

- **Optimized idea:**  
  Notice that all k-length segments overlap almost everywhere except for k positions apart.  
  Let’s group nums by index mod k:
  - Group 0: nums, nums[k], nums[2k], ...
  - Group 1: nums[1], nums[k+1], nums[2k+1], ...
  - etc.

  If we pick one value to substitute in each group, the XOR of one "cycle" is their XOR.  
  If for each group we decide the value, then every window has the same XOR.

- **DP approach:**  
  - For each group, try every possible value (0..1023; since nums[i] < 2¹⁰).
  - Use DP to track for each accumulated XOR what’s the minimum number of changes to make all previous groups (so far) such that the XOR equals x.
  - For each group, count how many numbers to change to make everyone in the group the same (frequency).
  - For the DP: dp[i][xor] = min steps to make the first i groups, so that the result of groups’ values is xor.

- **Why this works:**  
  This reduces overlapping constraints to non-overlapping subproblems by using the group structure and DP across possible xor sums.

### Corner cases to consider  
- k = 1 (every element is its own group)
- nums has all 0’s (already valid, expect output 0)
- n = k (only one segment, so all numbers must XOR to 0)
- All nums identical but not 0
- k > n (should never happen, but would be weird if allowed)
- nums contains only one value repeated in each group

### Solution

```python
def minChanges(nums, k):
    # Max value of nums[i] is less than 2^10, so up to 1<<10 different values
    MAXX = 1 << 10

    n = len(nums)
    # For each group by i % k, store freqs
    group_freq = [{} for _ in range(k)]
    group_sizes = [0] * k

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        idx = i % k
        group_freq[idx][num] = group_freq[idx].get(num, 0) + 1
        group_sizes[idx] += 1

    # DP array: after processing first g groups, dp[x] = min changes so that
    # current accumulated xor is x.
    dp_prev = [float('inf')] * MAXX
    dp_prev[0] = 0  # base: no changes, xor = 0

    for g in range(k):
        cnt = group_freq[g]
        size = group_sizes[g]
        dp_curr = [float('inf')] * MAXX

        # Precompute: changing all, so size at minimum
        min_prev = min(dp_prev)
        for x in range(MAXX):
            # Try setting all group-g elements to v (all possible values)
            # For value v:
            # - freq_v: count of v in this group
            # - cost: number of changes = size - freq_v
            for v in cnt:
                cost = size - cnt[v]
                candidate = dp_prev[x ^ v] + cost
                if candidate < dp_curr[x]:
                    dp_curr[x] = candidate
            # Or: set all to some value not in original group:
            # dp_curr[x] = min_prev + size

        # Consider assigning all new value (possibly not in group)
        for x in range(MAXX):
            candidate = min_prev + size
            if candidate < dp_curr[x]:
                dp_curr[x] = candidate

        dp_prev = dp_curr

    return dp_prev[0]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(k × MAXX × MAXX), where MAXX = 1024. For each group, for each possible xor value (1024), all candidate values used in this group (up to 1024, but usually less). In practice, this is fast due to small k and MAXX.
- **Space Complexity:** O(MAXX), only two arrays of length 1024 are kept (previous and current dp).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Suppose k is very large, close to n (say k = n-1). How does the logic change?  
  *Hint: Small number of groups, minimal overlap.*

- What if allowed to increment/decrement elements, not arbitrary assignment?  
  *Hint: You need to minimize total increment/decrement, not changes; variation of the covering problem.*

- If nums has only non-negative and all values < 2⁶, does it improve time or storage?  
  *Hint: Profile based on possible value space.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic **grouping + DP over states** problem. We efficiently compress overlapping segment constraints using modular grouping, so that we only need to consider the frequency of each value in each group. The DP over xor states is a standard bitmask DP pattern, often seen in problems involving XOR over subarrays or cycles, such as subset XOR or finding subsets with given xor properties. This technique generalizes to other segment/covering problems where overlap can be represented via modularity or state transition.
