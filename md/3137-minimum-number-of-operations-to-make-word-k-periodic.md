### Leetcode 3137 (Medium): Minimum Number of Operations to Make Word K-Periodic [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-word-k-periodic)

### Description  
Given a string `word` and an integer `k`, you can perform operations where you replace any substring of length `k` with any other substring of length `k` from within `word`. The goal is to determine the **minimum number of such operations** required to make the string k-periodic (i.e., it can be rebuilt by repeating the same substring of length `k`).

*For example, "ababab" with k = 2 is already 2-periodic because "ab" is repeated, but "abcabcac" with k = 3 is not 3-periodic because "abc" and "ac" are not the same.*

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `word = "abcabcab", k = 3`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: Split into ["abc", "abc", "ab"]. By changing "ab" to "abc" (replace last 2 chars 'ab' with 'abc'), all segments are "abc" and word is 3-periodic.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `word = "aaaa", k = 2`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation: Split into ["aa", "aa"]. Both are already the same, so zero operations are required.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `word = "abacab", k = 2`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: Split into ["ab", "ac", "ab"]. Need to change "ac" to "ab" (or "ab" to "ac" twice) so both substrings are the same.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, divide the string into `n // k` substrings of length `k`. The goal is to make all these substrings identical using the fewest replacements.  
A brute-force approach would test replacing each segment with every possible other segment and count operations, but this grows too fast as the number of segments increases.  
Instead, count the frequency of each substring segment. The segment which already occurs the most needs zero changes; all other segments need to be replaced with the most common segment.  
So, the minimum operations = (number of segments) - (frequency of most common segment).

This approach is optimal and can be implemented in one traversal and a frequency count.

### Corner cases to consider  
- String length not divisible by `k`. (Almost always, `word` has length divisible by `k`, else last segment will be shorter.)
- All segments are already identical - zero ops.
- All segments are different — needs n//k - 1 replacements at best.
- `k` = 1 (every character is its own substring).
- Large string and large `k`.

### Solution

```python
def minimumOperationsToMakeKPeriodic(word: str, k: int) -> int:
    # Count frequency of each substring of length k
    from collections import Counter
    
    n = len(word)
    substr_freq = Counter(word[i:i + k] for i in range(0, n, k))
    
    # Find the segment occurring most often
    max_count = max(substr_freq.values())
    
    # Total segments = n // k (assume n divisible by k)
    total_segments = n // k
    
    # The answer is: replace all other segments with the most frequent one
    return total_segments - max_count
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of `word`, since every k-sized substring is visited once and counted.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n/k), for storing the frequency of up to n/k substrings.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if `k` does not evenly divide the length of `word`?  
  *Hint: How will you handle the last segment if shorter than k?*

- Could you modify this for large-scale inputs where only constant extra space is allowed?  
  *Hint: Is it possible to process in-place or with rolling hash techniques?*

- How does the solution change if not allowed to copy substrings from within the word, but only set characters directly?  
  *Hint: Could you count frequency per character position modulo k?*

### Summary
This problem uses the **frequency counting** pattern on fixed-length substrings and reduces to counting the maximum frequency, similar to modes in arrays. It applies to strings, blocks, or grouped entities where unification under one value is allowed with swaps/replacements.  
The counting approach is frequently applicable for problems seeking a minimal number of changes to unify or equalize blocks.
