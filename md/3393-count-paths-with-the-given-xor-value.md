### Leetcode 3393 (Medium): Count Paths With the Given XOR Value [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-paths-with-the-given-xor-value)

### Description  
You are given an m × n grid of integers and an integer k. Starting from the top-left cell (0, 0), you can move either right or down at each step until you reach the bottom-right cell (m-1, n-1). For each path, compute the XOR (⊕) of all values in the cells along the path. The task is to count how many such paths have a total XOR equal to k.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `grid = [[2,1],[3,4]], k = 7`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: There are two possible paths:*  
- Path 1: 2 → 1 → 4, XOR = 2 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 4 = 7  
- Path 2: 2 → 3 → 4, XOR = 2 ⊕ 3 ⊕ 4 = 5  
*Only Path 1 results in XOR = 7.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `grid = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]], k = 0`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: No path from (0,0) to (2,2) with XOR equal to 0.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `grid = [[5]], k = 5`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Only one path, the value itself; 5 == 5.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
Start by considering a brute-force approach: enumerate all paths from (0,0) to (m-1,n-1), calculating the XOR for each path and counting those that equal k. However, this approach is infeasible due to exponential path growth: O(2^{m+n-2}) for an m×n grid.

To optimize, note:
- The XOR value for each path depends only on the XOR value so far and the current grid cell.
- At each cell, the number of ways to arrive with a specific XOR value can be computed using results from its top and left neighbors.
- Use dynamic programming: let dp[i][j][xor_val] be the number of ways to reach (i, j) with XOR value xor_val.
- For each cell, iterate over all possible XORs reached in cells above (i-1, j) and to the left (i, j-1), and update current state by including grid[i][j].

This reduces time/space from exponential to O(m × n × maxXor) where maxXor is the largest possible XOR result based on constraints.  
Use modulo 10⁹+7 for outputs.

### Corner cases to consider  
- 1×1 grids (start == end cell).
- k not reachable for any path (should return 0).
- All grid values are zero or equal.
- Paths where the same XOR value can be formed via different routes.
- Large grid sizes; check memory/time usage.
- k equals 0; must not confuse with uninitialized values.

### Solution

```python
from typing import List
from functools import lru_cache

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def countPathsWithXorValue(grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

    # Use LRU cache for memoization to avoid recomputation
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def dp(i, j, xor_val):
        # Base case: reached bottom-right cell
        if i == m - 1 and j == n - 1:
            return 1 if xor_val == k else 0

        res = 0
        # Move right
        if j + 1 < n:
            res += dp(i, j+1, xor_val ^ grid[i][j+1])
        # Move down
        if i + 1 < m:
            res += dp(i+1, j, xor_val ^ grid[i+1][j])

        return res % MOD

    return dp(0, 0, grid[0][0])
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(m × n × X), where X is the number of distinct possible XOR values. For small integer values in grid, X can be up to 1024 or 2¹⁰ (if grid[i][j] < 1024), but for larger integers, X can grow up. However, in practice, number of subproblems is manageable because each step is limited by path and value combinations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m × n × X) due to memoization/caching of subproblems. No recursion stack overflow for reasonable grid sizes due to Python’s optimization, assuming X isn’t too large.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you adapt this solution if grid values or k can be very large (e.g., up to 10⁹)?  
  *Hint: Consider how the number of unique XOR states affects memory and whether bit masking or pruning is possible.*

- Can you solve this with iterative DP (tabulation), avoiding recursion?  
  *Hint: Use a rolling DP structure or dictionaries per cell to store counts by XOR value.*

- How would you handle the variant where diagonal moves are allowed?  
  *Hint: Add an additional possible move direction at each step and update DP accordingly.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic example of **DP on grids with state** (the state here being current cell and the XOR so far). Instead of storing all paths, we count ways for each distinct partial result, using memoization. This “DP with extra parameter” approach and subproblem reuse is common in grid DP, path counting with constraints, word search with constraints, or mahjong-like game move counting.
