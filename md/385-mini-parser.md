### Leetcode 385 (Medium): Mini Parser [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/mini-parser)

### Description  
Given a string s representing the serialization of a nested list, implement a parser that deserializes it and returns a NestedInteger.  
Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements can also be integers or other lists.  
- The input is a string using digits, '[', ']', '-', and ',' with no spaces.
- Examples: "324", "[123,[456,]]".

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `324`  
Output: `324`  
*Explanation: The string is just an integer, so the NestedInteger object represents the integer 324.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `[123,[456,]]`  
Output: `[123,[456,]]`  
*Explanation:  
- The outermost list has two elements:  
  - 123 (an integer)  
  - [456,] (a nested list)  
    - 456 (an integer)  
    -  (a nested list containing one integer, 789).*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `[-1,[2,-3],4]`  
Output: `[-1,[2,-3],4]`  
*Explanation:  
- Outermost list of three elements:  
  - -1 (integer)  
  - [2,-3] (list of integers)  
  - 4 (integer).*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

First, determine if the input is just a flat integer, or a nested list structure.
- If the string doesn’t start with '[', it's a single integer: just return NestedInteger(int).
- Otherwise, it's a list possibly containing integers and nested lists.

Use a stack to build up the structure as you parse:
- Loop through the input string character by character.
- Push new NestedInteger objects onto the stack when encountering '['.
- Track digits (and a possible '-' for negatives) to read integer values.
- When encountering a ',' or ']', if a number was being built, convert and add it to the current NestedInteger.
- If encountering ']', pop the top NestedInteger, and add it to the previous one (unless it’s the root).

This stack-based iterative method avoids recursion stack overflow, and is easy to follow step by step. DFS/stack-based tree construction fits the recursive nested structure described by the problem[2][3].

### Corner cases to consider  
- String is a single integer, e.g., `"5"`.
- Nested empty lists, e.g., `"[]"`.
- Negative numbers and multi-digit numbers, e.g., `"[-12,34]"`.
- Lists with just one element, e.g., `""`.
- Deeply nested single-value lists, e.g., `"[[-1]]"`.
- Large or minimal input length.

### Solution

```python
# This implementation assumes the NestedInteger class is provided.
# You should implement the logic using no shortcuts or external libraries.

class NestedInteger:
    def __init__(self, value=None):
        if value is None:
            self._list = []
            self._integer = None
        else:
            self._list = None
            self._integer = value

    def isInteger(self):
        return self._integer is not None

    def add(self, elem):
        if self._list is not None:
            self._list.append(elem)
        else:
            self._list = [elem]
            self._integer = None

    def setInteger(self, value):
        self._integer = value
        self._list = None

    def getInteger(self):
        return self._integer

    def getList(self):
        return self._list

def deserialize(s):
    # Case: single integer
    if s[0] != '[':
        return NestedInteger(int(s))
    
    stack = []
    num = None # current number
    sign = 1   # current sign
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char == '-':
            sign = -1
        elif char.isdigit():
            if num is None:
                num = 0
            num = num * 10 + int(char)
        elif char == '[':
            stack.append(NestedInteger())
        elif char == ',' or char == ']':
            if num is not None:
                stack[-1].add(NestedInteger(sign * num))
                num = None
                sign = 1
            if char == ']' and len(stack) > 1:
                ni = stack.pop()
                stack[-1].add(ni)
    return stack[0]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed once in a single pass, and every structure (NestedInteger, list, or int) is built as we go.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n). Stack depth grows proportional to the nesting of the structure. Additionally, constructed NestedInteger objects take extra space linear in the input.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle malformed or invalid input strings?
  *Hint: What if an input contains mismatched brackets or missing numbers?*

- Can you modify the solution to return an error or exception for overly deep nesting?
  *Hint: Monitor the depth of the stack during parsing.*

- What changes are needed to support whitespace in the input?
  *Hint: Allow and skip spaces when parsing each character.*

### Summary
This problem employs a stack-based parsing pattern, matching the recursive/nested (tree-like) nature of the input. Stack-based or DFS algorithms are common in problems dealing with parsing, evaluating, or reconstructing nested structures such as expressions, JSON, or tree serialization. Recognizing when to use a stack or recursion is essential for tackling these kinds of tasks efficiently.
