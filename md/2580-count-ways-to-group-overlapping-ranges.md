### Leetcode 2580 (Medium): Count Ways to Group Overlapping Ranges [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-group-overlapping-ranges)

### Description  
Given a list of ranges where each range is a pair [start, end] (inclusive), count the number of distinct ways to partition these ranges into groups such that:
- Each range must be placed in exactly one group.
- Any ranges that overlap (i.e., share at least one integer) must be placed in the same group.
Return the count modulo 10⁹+7.

In other words, count how many ways you can divide the input intervals such that every group contains only non-overlapping sets—except overlapping intervals are always grouped together.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `ranges = [[1,3],[2,5],[6,7]]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: [1,3] and [2,5] overlap, so they must be grouped together. [6,7] does not overlap with either. There are 2 groups: { [1,3],[2,5] }, { [6,7] }. These groups can either go into group 1 and group 2, or vice versa: Total ways = 2.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `ranges = [[1,2],[3,4]]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: Neither interval overlaps, so each forms its own group. Each group can be independently in group 1 or group 2. Total ways = 2 × 2 = 4.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `ranges = [[1,10],[2,8],[5,7]]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: All intervals overlap since [1,10] covers everything. Only 1 group, and it can go into group 1 or group 2. Total ways = 2.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, I want to group together all intervals that overlap with each other—these make up a "component" that must stay together in any grouping.  
A brute-force is to try all possible pairings, but that's clearly exponential and won't work.

Optimized idea:
- If I merge all overlapping ranges together and count how many *non-overlapping* merged groups there are, these are the minimal set of required groups.
- Each such group can independently be put into group 1 or group 2, so the answer is 2^(number of merged groups).
- To find these merged groups, I:
  - Sort intervals by start.
  - Merge overlapping intervals using a sweep line method.
  - For each new disjoint group, double the answer.

This approach leverages interval merging (similar to "merge intervals" pattern) and combinatorics.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty input: Should return 1, as there's only one way to do nothing.
- All intervals overlap (completely nested): Only 2 ways.
- All intervals are disjoint: 2ⁿ ways.
- Fully contained intervals (e.g., [1,10], [2,3]): Still makes just one group.
- Intervals that touch at boundaries (e.g., [1,2] and [2,3]): Should count as overlapping based on whether "sharing at least one" means sharing a number, e.g., both include 2.

### Solution

```python
def countWays(ranges):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    if not ranges:
        return 1

    # Sort intervals by their start value
    ranges.sort()
    res = 1
    prev_end = -1

    for start, end in ranges:
        # If current interval starts after last merged group ends, it's a new group
        if start > prev_end:
            res = (res * 2) % MOD
        # Extend current group end if necessary
        prev_end = max(prev_end, end)
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), for sorting the ranges (where n is number of intervals). The following merge/grouping pass is O(n).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space (apart from input), since only a few integer variables are used (even sorting done in-place).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you want to output all the possible groupings, not just count them?
  *Hint: Think recursively, generating combinations as in merge intervals recursively.*

- How would you adapt this for k groups instead of exactly 2?
  *Hint: Each group could go into any of the k groups. Count = k^(number of components).*

- Can you handle very large n (e.g., 10⁷ intervals) efficiently if they fit in memory?
  *Hint: Minimize data movement. Could you do a single sweep using extra O(1) storage?*

### Summary
This problem combines the interval merge pattern (sweep line/merge intervals) with combinatorics. By grouping overlapping intervals, we can think of each non-overlapping "component" as independently assignable, leading to a classic power-of-2 pattern similar to set partitioning. This pattern appears in interval scheduling, connected components (graph problems), and combinatorial set splitting tasks.
