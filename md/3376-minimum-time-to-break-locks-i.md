### Leetcode 3376 (Medium): Minimum Time to Break Locks I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-break-locks-i)

### Description  
Given an array **strength** of size n where strength[i] is the energy needed to break the iᵗʰ lock, and an integer **k**.  
Bob has a sword that charges over time, starting with energy 0 and charging at a rate of **x** (initially 1).  
Each minute, the sword gains **x** energy; as soon as its energy meets or exceeds strength[i], Bob can break that lock instantly and the sword's energy resets to 0, but the factor **x** increases by **k**.  
The problem is to find the **minimum total time (in minutes)** needed to break all the locks, using the optimal order.  
**n** is small (1 ≤ n ≤ 8), so all permutations can be considered.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `strength = [3,4,3]`, `k = 1`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation:*
- At minute 1, sword energy is 1
- At minute 2, sword energy is 2
- At minute 3, sword energy is 3 → break first lock (strength 3), reset energy, **x** becomes 2
- At minute 4, sword energy is 2 → not enough, at minute 5, sword energy is 4 → break second lock (strength 4), **x** becomes 3  
- Continue for third lock.  
Optimal order takes minimum 4 minutes.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `strength = [2,5,4]`, `k = 2`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation:*
- Start with x=1, wait until energy reaches 2 (minute 2), break first lock, x=3.
- Next, at minute 3, energy=3 (not enough), at minute 4, energy=6 (enough for lock 2), break, x=5.
- Remaining lock: at minute 5, energy=5 (>4), break.
Total time is 5.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `strength = [1]`, `k = 5`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation:*
- Only one lock with required strength 1, x=1. In 1 minute energy reaches 1, break it.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- Try all orders; n is very small (up to 8), so permutations or bitmask DP is acceptable.
- For each lock, calculate the number of minutes to reach at least strength[i] with current x:
  - time_needed = ⌈strength[i] / x⌉ (can be calculated as (strength[i]-1)//x + 1)
- After breaking a lock, update x = x + k, continue for remaining locks.
- Use recursion (DFS + memoization/DP with bitmask) to avoid recomputation of states (masking which locks are already broken, current x).
- Brute-force: try every sequence (O(n! × per-step)), but optimize with memoization so repeated subproblems aren't recalculated.
- Tradeoff: Bitmask DP uses more space but is needed for speed. With n ≤ 8, total number of DP states is manageable (≲ 2⁸ × max x).

### Corner cases to consider  
- Only 1 lock (minimum case)
- All strength values are the same
- k=1 vs k>1
- Locks with strength of 1
- Maximum k, maximum strength
- Order matters: breaking easier locks first may result in a better x for harder ones

### Solution

```python
def minimumTimeToBreakLocks(strength, k):
    n = len(strength)
    from functools import lru_cache

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def dp(used_mask, x):
        if used_mask == (1 << n) - 1:
            return 0  # all locks done

        min_time = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            if not (used_mask & (1 << i)):
                # minutes to charge enough to break lock i
                need = strength[i]
                # time_needed = ceil(need/x)
                time_needed = (need - 1) // x + 1
                rest = dp(used_mask | (1 << i), x + k)
                total_time = time_needed + rest
                min_time = min(min_time, total_time)
        return min_time

    return dp(0, 1)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n × 2ⁿ). There are 2ⁿ possible states for the bitmask, each with up to n choices. Each recursive call tries every lock not yet broken.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n × 2ⁿ) for the DP memoization table, (plus recursion stack up to n depth).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if **n** becomes larger?  
  *Hint: Think about how to prune state space or make greedy choices.*

- Can we optimize memory usage in the DP?  
  *Hint: Could you reduce dimensions or discard less likely states?*

- How would you return not just the minimum time, but also the actual sequence of locks broken?  
  *Hint: Add parent/trace-back info in your memoization.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic use-case for **bitmask Dynamic Programming** (DP) for small n, frequently seen in optimal ordering/sequencing problems.  
Pattern: “Trying every order with memoization / DP (bitmask)” is very useful when the number of objects (locks/tasks) is small, but the number of possible sequences is factorial-sized.  
The pattern can be used for problems around job scheduling, shortest path visiting all nodes, and permutation DP questions.
