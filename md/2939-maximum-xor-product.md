### Leetcode 2939 (Medium): Maximum Xor Product [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-product)

### Description  
Given three integers **a**, **b**, and **n**, find the maximum value of (**a** XOR **x**) × (**b** XOR **x**) as **x** ranges from 0 to 2ⁿ - 1.  
Return the answer modulo 10⁹ + 7.  
- **XOR**: bitwise exclusive-or between numbers.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `a=5, b=10, n=4`  
Output: `500`  
*Explanation: Try all x from 0 to 15. The maximum (a⊕x)×(b⊕x) is for x=15. (5⊕15)=10, (10⊕15)=5. 10×5 = 50. (*But see reasoning below—this is illustrative; validate with code)*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `a=3, b=8, n=3`  
Output: `35`  
*Explanation: Try all x from 0 to 7. Maximum is for x=7: (3⊕7)=4, (8⊕7)=15. 4×15=60. The optimal x may differ; use bit manip for maximization.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `a=7, b=7, n=2`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: When both a and b are equal, (a⊕x)×(b⊕x) = y×y for all x. Maximum is for x yielding maximum single value.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute-force:** Try every x from 0 to 2ⁿ-1, compute (a⊕x)\*(b⊕x), and keep the max.  
  - Problem: For n=30, this is O(2ⁿ), totally infeasible.

- **Optimization Insight:**  
  - The result depends on how we flip the bits of a and b to maximize the product.  
  - At each bit position (starting from the highest), we decide whether to set that bit in x to 0 or 1, aiming to balance (a⊕x) and (b⊕x) to maximize their product.
  - It’s beneficial for (a⊕x) and (b⊕x) to be as close as possible, as the product is maximized when two numbers are closest (given a+b is constant).

- **Greedy bit construction:**  
  - Iterate from MSB (most significant bit) to LSB, construct modified_a and modified_b such that they form the closest possible values (but not necessarily equal, since a and b may differ).  
  - If a and b have the same bit, set that bit in both. If not, assign the bigger one to have this bit, so the two results stay close.

- **Trade-offs:**  
  - This approach is O(n) and uses constant space. Bit manip is often optimal for XOR/maximizing in a range.

### Corner cases to consider  
- a = b (max product is always for x=0).
- n is 0 (only x = 0 allowed).
- a and b have MSBs beyond n (should mask them off).
- a or b is 0.
- Large input (need mod at every step).

### Solution

```python
def maximumXorProduct(a: int, b: int, n: int) -> int:
    mod = 10**9 + 7
    # Create "masks" for n bits
    mask = (1 << n) - 1
    # Only n lowest bits
    a &= mask
    b &= mask
    ax, bx = 0, 0
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        abit = (a >> i) & 1
        bbit = (b >> i) & 1
        if abit == bbit:
            # Set the bit in both numbers
            ax |= abit << i
            bx |= bbit << i
        else:
            # Assign the current bit to the smaller, to balance towards maximum product
            if ax < bx:
                ax |= 1 << i
            else:
                bx |= 1 << i
    # Take modulo (required by problem)
    return (ax * bx) % mod
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  There is a single loop running for n bits; each iteration is constant work.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  All variables are integers; no extra data structures are used. Only a constant amount of space.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if a and b are very large (64-bit)? Can your solution adapt?  
  *Hint: Modify mask and bit loop to handle up to 64 bits.*

- What if you want to return not only the maximum product but also the x that achieves it?  
  *Hint: Track the constructed value of x as you choose each bit.*

- If n is extremely large (say, 10⁵), can you optimize further?  
  *Hint: Early out if a and b share leading n bits; otherwise, bit manip is still linear.*

### Summary
This problem leverages **bit manipulation** and a **greedy constructive approach** to maximize (a⊕x)×(b⊕x) in a restricted x-range. Instead of brute-forcing all possibilities, we decide each bit optimally from MSB to LSB, similar to problems that require maximizing XOR or constructing values under bitwise constraints. This method is common in problems involving “maximize/minimize under XOR and range,” and is widely applicable in bitmask-based interview questions.
