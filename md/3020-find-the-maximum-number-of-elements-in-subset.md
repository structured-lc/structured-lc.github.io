### Leetcode 3020 (Medium): Find the Maximum Number of Elements in Subset [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-number-of-elements-in-subset)

### Description  
You are given an array of positive integers, nums. Find the size of the largest possible subset which, when sorted, forms a palindrome sequence that first increases by squaring from a base number x up to xᵏ (for some k ≥ 0), and then mirrors back down.  
So, the valid subset pattern is:  
[x, x², x⁴, ..., x²ⁱ, ..., x⁴, x², x]  
For example: [2, 4, 16, 4, 2] (since 2²=4; 4²=16; then symmetric).

Not all numbers/palindromic patterns are valid: every element must exist in the input and appear with enough frequency for the palindromic structure.  
Return the maximum possible size for such a subset.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [2, 4, 16, 4, 2]`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation: The whole array forms the valid pattern [2, 4, 16, 4, 2] (palindromic, squares of 2), so size is 5.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [3, 9, 3]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: [3, 9, 3] forms a valid pattern since 3² = 9, then mirrored.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [2, 4, 8, 4, 2]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Although this is palindromic, 8 is not a repeated squaring of 2, so only [2, 4, 2] is a valid pattern.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force:**  
  - Enumerate all possible subsets. For each, check if it’s a palindrome and a repeated-squared pattern. This is exponential and not practical.

- **Optimized approach:**  
  - Key insight: All valid subsets must look like: [x, x², x⁴, ..., x²ⁱ, ..., x⁴, x², x] for some x.
  - Pick each unique x in nums as a base.  
  - Count the available frequency for x, x², x⁴, etc. For each such chain (until you run out of needed numbers), count how many pairs you can make (each mid-layer needs two copies except the center).  
  - Try to grow the sequence as much as possible for every x, updating the best result.
  - Special case: x=1. Since 1ⁿ = 1, count max possible odd length using available 1s.
  - Use hashing (dictionary) for efficient counting.

- **Why this approach:**  
  - Exploits both the palindrome and repeated-square requirements simultaneously.
  - Avoids unnecessary subset generation.  

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty input (`nums = []`).
- Single element (`nums = [a]`).
- All elements are 1 (`nums = [1,1,1,1]`).
- No repeated squares, eg, [2, 5, 6].
- Large counts for a single value.
- Large powers that may not fit in normal int (py handles but watch in other langs).
- Random array, not sorted or containing junk numbers.
- Input with duplicate non-chain values.

### Solution

```python
def maximumLength(nums):
    # Count occurrences of each number
    count = {}
    for num in nums:
        count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1

    max_len = 0

    # Handle x = 1 separately, all powers of 1 are 1
    if 1 in count:
        # max odd length ≤ count[1]
        max_len = count[1] - (count[1] % 2 == 0)

    # Try all other numbers as base
    for x in count:
        if x == 1:
            continue
        k = x
        length = 0
        # Temporary, records how far the chain can go
        while k in count and count[k] >= 2:
            length += 2
            k = k * k
        # Center of palindrome (odd length), if k exists at last step
        if k in count:
            length += 1
        max_len = max(max_len, length)

    return max_len
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log M)  
  n = len(nums), M = max(nums).  
  Counting is O(n). For each unique base x, in worst case may walk up log₂(max(nums)) squarings (since k\*k grows fast).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
  Mainly the dictionary for frequency counting (proportional to number of unique nums).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you needed the count of different valid patterns, not just the maximum size?  
  *Hint: Track the exact chain for each base and count each unique palindrome structure.*

- Can you return the actual subset (or one valid arrangement), not just the size?  
  *Hint: Reconstruct by iterating along the longest valid chain for base x with corresponding frequencies.*

- How do you handle overflow if constraints are much larger or in other languages?  
  *Hint: Squaring grows quickly; check if intermediate k exceeds allowed range during chain building.*

### Summary
This problem uses the **hashing + greedy chain extension** pattern: try every unique candidate as a root, chain out via a mathematical property (here, repeated squaring), and greedily build the longest valid sequence with available counts. This pattern is common in problems involving sequence construction or frequency buckets (like largest consecutive sequence, grouping, counting palindromes). The hashing and chain-walking idea generalizes to related sequence or palindrome problems.
