### Leetcode 2946 (Easy): Matrix Similarity After Cyclic Shifts [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-similarity-after-cyclic-shifts)

### Description  
Given an m × n integer matrix `mat` and an integer `k`, you perform k cyclic shifts on each row as follows:
- For each even-indexed row (0, 2, 4, ...), cyclically shift the row to the **left** k times.
- For each odd-indexed row (1, 3, 5, ...), cyclically shift the row to the **right** k times.

If after these shifts, the final matrix is **identical** to the original, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

A cyclic left (right) shift means every element moves one position to the left (right), wrapping around at ends.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `mat = [[1,2,1,2],[5,5,5,5],[6,3,6,3]], k = 2`  
Output: `True`  
*Explanation:  
- Row 0 (even): Shift left 2 → [1,2,1,2] → [1,2,1,2]  
- Row 1 (odd): Shift right 2 → [5,5,5,5] → [5,5,5,5]  
- Row 2 (even): Shift left 2 → [6,3,6,3] → [6,3,6,3]  
All rows stay the same. Final matrix is identical to the original.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `mat = [[2,2],[2,2]], k = 3`  
Output: `True`  
*Explanation:  
- Both rows are the same with identical elements, so any shift keeps them unchanged.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `mat = [[1,2]], k = 1`  
Output: `False`  
*Explanation:  
- Row 0 (even): Shift left 1 → [1,2] → [2,1]  
Result is [[2,1]], which is NOT identical to [[1,2]].*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, the brute-force approach would be to simulate k shifts on each row and compare with the original, but that's inefficient.  
On analysis, performing k cyclic shifts on a row of length n brings the row back to its original state if and only if (k % n) == 0.  
So, for each row, we can compute the effective moves (k mod n_rowsize), shift left if even index or right if odd index, and compare with the original directly. Since n and k are small, direct string or array comparison is fine.  
This approach is efficient and eliminates unnecessary repeated shifting.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Single row or single column matrix.
- k = 0 (no shifts at all, so should return True).
- All rows/columns with identical elements.
- k > number of columns (reduces to k % n).
- Matrices where after shifting, values appear to match except in one row.

### Solution

```python
def areTheySimilar(mat, k):
    m = len(mat)
    n = len(mat[0])
    
    for i in range(m):
        moves = k % n
        # For even-indexed row: left shift
        if i % 2 == 0:
            shifted_row = mat[i][moves:] + mat[i][:moves]
        # For odd-indexed row: right shift
        else:
            shifted_row = mat[i][-moves:] + mat[i][:-moves]
        if shifted_row != mat[i]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(m × n).  
  We traverse every row and, for each, create a shifted version (O(n)), with m rows total.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n) extra per row (for the slice shifted_row), but could be O(1) if we compare in-place or cyclically.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the matrix was very large and you couldn't make copies of entire rows?  
  *Hint: Can you compare row elements in cyclic order without extra storage?*

- Can this be solved in-place with O(1) additional space?  
  *Hint: Pointer or double-index approach, compare without full row copy.*

- What if k may be negative (left/right shift direction varies)?  
  *Hint: Normalize shift direction depending on k’s sign.*

### Summary
This problem uses the cyclic array shifting pattern, optimized with modulo arithmetic to shortcut unnecessary work (common for problems involving repeated rotations or cycles). This technique is broadly applicable to cyclic buffer, array rotation, or periodic sequence comparison problems.
