### Leetcode 570 (Medium): Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/managers-with-at-least-5-direct-reports)

### Description  
You're given an **Employee** table, containing information about employees and their managers. Each row has an employee's `id`, `name`, `department`, and `managerId`.  
The goal: **Find all managers who have at least 5 direct reports**—that is, employees where their `managerId` matches the manager's `id`.  
Return a table with a single column, `name`, for each such manager.  
This is a classic "self-join" or "group-by" problem testing your ability to navigate organizational relationships.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
Employee table:

| id  | name  | department | managerId |
|-----|-------|------------|-----------|
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | A          | 101       |
| 107 | Chip  | A          | 102       |

Output:  
`name`  
John  

*Explanation: John (id 101) is the manager of Dan, James, Amy, Anne, and Ron (5 direct reports). No other manager has at least 5 direct reports.*

**Example 2:**  
Input:  
Employee table:

| id  | name  | department | managerId |
|-----|-------|------------|-----------|
| 201 | Alice | HR         | null      |
| 202 | Bob   | HR         | 201       |
| 203 | Carol | HR         | 201       |
| 204 | Dave  | HR         | 202       |
| 205 | Erin  | HR         | 202       |

Output:  
(no rows)  

*Explanation: No manager with at least 5 direct reports.*

**Example 3:**  
Input:  
Employee table:

| id  | name  | department | managerId |
|-----|-------|------------|-----------|
| 301 | Sim   | Tech       | null      |
| 302 | Tom   | Tech       | 301       |
| 303 | Jerry | Tech       | 301       |
| 304 | Max   | Tech       | 301       |
| 305 | Zoe   | Tech       | 301       |
| 306 | Jeff  | Tech       | 301       |
| 307 | Rick  | Tech       | 302       |
| 308 | Rob   | Tech       | 303       |

Output:  
`name`  
Sim  

*Explanation: Sim (id 301) manages 5 direct reports (Tom, Jerry, Max, Zoe, Jeff).*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute force**: I could check for each employee how many people report to them by iterating through the list for every person. This has O(n²) time and is not practical.
- **Efficient approach**:  
  - **Group by** on `managerId` and count the number of employees for each manager.
  - Select only those managers whose count is ≥ 5.
  - To get the name, join with the original employee table where the manager's `id` matches the `managerId` that qualified.
  - This uses efficient grouping and joining, which databases and pandas both handle well.
- The **final approach** uses grouping and a join, which is efficient and directly solves the problem.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Employees without a manager (managerId=null, e.g., CEO) should not count as their own manager.
- If no manager has ≥5 reports, the output should be empty.
- Multiple managers may tie with exactly 5 (or more) direct reports.
- Employees may be assigned themselves as manager (rare, but could occur in bad data).
- Duplicate employee rows (shouldn't happen if id is unique, but possible in data).

### Solution

```python
def find_managers(employee):
    # Step 1: Count number of reports for each managerId
    manager_report_count = {}
    for row in employee:
        manager_id = row['managerId']
        if manager_id is not None:
            manager_report_count[manager_id] = manager_report_count.get(manager_id, 0) + 1

    # Step 2: Collect manager ids with >=5 direct reports
    qualifying_managers = set()
    for manager_id, count in manager_report_count.items():
        if count >= 5:
            qualifying_managers.add(manager_id)

    # Step 3: Output names of managers (from employees table) whose id is a qualifying manager
    result = []
    for row in employee:
        if row['id'] in qualifying_managers:
            result.append({'name': row['name']})

    return result
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of employees.  
    - - Single pass to count reports (O(n)).
    - - Single pass to scan and output manager names (O(n)).

- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case (O(unique managers)), as we store counts for potentially all employees.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle showing the full list of direct report names for each qualifying manager?  
  *Hint: Use nested grouping or build a mapping from managerId to direct reports, then output accordingly.*

- What if you needed all managers ordered by their number of direct reports?  
  *Hint: Store counts as (managerId, count) pairs, then sort by count.*

- How to optimize if the table is extremely large and cannot fit into memory?  
  *Hint: Use database aggregation and streaming techniques instead of in-memory structures.*

### Summary
This problem showcases the “**self-join**” or “group-by and join” pattern for organizational hierarchy problems. It’s widely applicable in employee-manager reporting, ancestry trees, or any domain where direct relationships must be counted and matched back for full data retrieval. Efficient group-by and filtering logic is key for such relationship-aggregation queries, both for database SQL and in-memory data processing.
