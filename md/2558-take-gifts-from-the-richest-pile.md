### Leetcode 2558 (Easy): Take Gifts From the Richest Pile [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/take-gifts-from-the-richest-pile)

### Description  
Given an array of positive integers `gifts`, each representing a pile of gifts, and an integer `k`, perform the following operation `k` times:  
- Choose the pile with the most gifts (if there are multiple, choose any).
- Take all but the floor of its square root gifts from that pile (that is, after the operation, the chosen pile has ⌊√current_pile⌋ gifts left).  
Return the total number of gifts remaining in all piles after performing this operation `k` times.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `gifts = [25,64,9,4,100]`, `k = 4`  
Output: `29`  
*Explanation:  
1. Choose pile 100 → leave 10 (pile now [25,64,9,4,10])  
2. Choose pile 64 → leave 8 (now [25,8,9,4,10])  
3. Choose pile 25 → leave 5 (now [5,8,9,4,10])  
4. Choose pile 10 → leave 3 (now [5,8,9,4,3])  
Sum: 5 + 8 + 9 + 4 + 3 = 29*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `gifts = [1,1,1,1]`, `k = 4`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation:  
No matter which pile you choose, ⌊√1⌋ = 1, so each pile remains unchanged.  
Total remaining: 4*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `gifts = [9,7,4,1]`, `k = 3`  
Output: `13`  
*Explanation:  
1. Choose pile 9 → leave 3 ([3,7,4,1])  
2. Choose pile 7 → leave 2 ([3,2,4,1])  
3. Choose pile 4 → leave 2 ([3,2,2,1])  
Sum: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8*  
(Note: The result is 8, not 13, based on simulated steps.)

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute force:**  
  For `k` iterations, scan the array to find the pile with the most gifts, modify it as per the rules, repeat. This is O(kn), which could be too slow for large n and k.

- **Optimize:**  
  The key bottleneck is repeatedly finding the largest pile, which calls for an efficient data structure.
  - A *max-heap* (priority queue) allows extracting and updating the maximum in O(log n) per operation.
  - In Python, `heapq` is min-heap by default, so we can store negative values to simulate a max-heap.
  - For each iteration, pop the largest (i.e., heappop), calculate the new value (⌊√max_pile⌋), then push it back.  
  - After k operations, sum the heap (convert negatives back to positives).

- **Trade-offs:**  
  - Max-heap approach reduces time to O(k log n), efficient for the problem constraints.
  - It's clean, reliable, and matches interview expectations for this class of problem.

### Corner cases to consider  
- gifts has only one pile (len(gifts) = 1)
- k is 0 (no operation; return sum of gifts unchanged)
- All piles are equal
- All piles have 1 as the value (cannot decrease further)
- gifts contains maximum allowed integers (test integer overflow/large numbers)
- k > number of piles (possibly revisiting the same pile)

### Solution

```python
def pickGifts(gifts, k):
    # We use a max-heap, simulate by pushing -gift values (since heapq is min-heap by default)
    import heapq
    
    # Convert all piles to negative for max-heap simulation
    max_heap = [-gift for gift in gifts]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    
    for _ in range(k):
        # Pop the largest pile (smallest negative)
        curr = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        
        # Calculate how many gifts remain after taking gifts from this pile
        remain = int(curr ** 0.5)  # floor of sqrt
        
        # Push the updated pile back to the heap (as negative)
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -remain)
    
    # The heap has all piles' negatives, sum negatives and invert to get total
    return -sum(max_heap)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(k log n).  
  Each of the k operations does heap pop and push (O(log n)), making total O(k log n). Building the heap is O(n).

- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(n).  
  The heap stores n elements (one per pile). Extra space for variables is negligible.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if k is very large (e.g., 10⁹)?  
  *Hint: Can you detect when the heaps stop changing (all piles are 1)? Early termination possible.*

- How would your solution change if you needed to also report how many gifts were taken in total?  
  *Hint: Accumulate taken gifts each step instead of only summing remains.*

- Can you solve this in O(n) space even if the number of operations is huge?  
  *Hint: When all piles reach 1, further operations become redundant.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic example of *priority queue* optimization, specifically using a max-heap for greedy extraction and update of the maximum element. It's a pattern that appears in "repeatedly take the largest/smallest and update" problems, such as stone-smashing, task scheduling, or resource distribution. Mastery here translates directly to a number of similar heap and greedy interview problems.
