### Leetcode 1626 (Medium): Best Team With No Conflicts [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-team-with-no-conflicts)

### Description  
Build the best (highest total score) team from a set of players, each with a score and an age, with the restriction that **no younger player chosen has a strictly higher score than an older player**. You're given two lists: scores and ages of each player. The team may include any number of players (including none). Return the maximum total score possible while satisfying the restriction.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `scores = [1,3,5,10,15], ages = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
Output: `34`  
*Explanation: No conflicts exist. Take all players: 1+3+5+10+15=34*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `scores = [4,5,6,5], ages = [2,1,2,1]`  
Output: `16`  
*Explanation: Group [5,6,5] has age [1,2,1] and total score 16 or [4,5,6] with ages [2,1,2].*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `scores = [1,2,3,5], ages = [8,9,10,1]`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation: Choose team [1,2,3] with total = 6.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The key part is: "no younger player can have a strictly higher score than an older one."  
- We can sort the players by age, breaking ties by score, so when we build the team, we only need to ensure non-decreasing scores for non-decreasing ages.
- After sorting, the problem becomes finding the maximum sum of a subsequence where scores are non-decreasing, similar to **Longest Increasing Subsequence** but maximizing score sum.
- For each player i, compute the best team sum ending at i by considering previous players j (with j < i and scores[j] ≤ scores[i]).
- This is O(n²), but you can improve to O(n log n) with a segment tree or BIT if needed (rarely in interviews).

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty input (both lists empty)  
- All players have same age  
- All players have the same score  
- Only one player  
- Scores decrease/remain the same as age increases  
- Large variations in age and score with conflicting orders

### Solution

```python
from typing import List

def bestTeamScore(scores: List[int], ages: List[int]) -> int:
    # Pair each player with (age, score)
    players = sorted(zip(ages, scores))
    n = len(players)
    dp = [0] * n  # dp[i] = best team score ending at player i
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = players[i][1]
        for j in range(i):
            if players[j][1] <= players[i][1]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + players[i][1])
    return max(dp)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²). Sorting is O(n log n), but the nested loop is O(n²).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the dp array and O(n) for sorting the players.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Could you optimize this further using a segment tree or binary indexed tree?  
  *Hint: Map scores to coordinate indices, then use range max queries to speed up.*

- What if the number of players is very large (e.g., 100,000)?  
  *Hint: You need O(n log n) or O(n) solution -- consider dynamic programming with fast updates.*

- How would you reconstruct the actual team members, not just the score?  
  *Hint: Track previous indices during dp updates for reconstruction.*

### Summary
This problem fits the **Dynamic Programming + Greedy Sort** pattern. Sort by constraints to convert to a 1D subsequence problem, then use dp to track optimal team composition. Similar ideas arise in box stacking, Russian Doll envelopes, or any "choose maximal subset with pairwise constraints".
