### Leetcode 2232 (Medium): Minimize Result by Adding Parentheses to Expression [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-result-by-adding-parentheses-to-expression)

### Description  
Given a string in the form "num₁+num₂", with both num₁ and num₂ as positive integers, you must insert exactly one pair of parentheses so that the left parenthesis is somewhere to the left of the '+' and the right parenthesis is to the right of '+'. The goal is to form a valid expression which, when computed, gives the smallest possible result. Return the new string with parentheses inserted at the positions which minimize the computed value. If multiple placements yield the minimum, any valid one may be returned.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `expression = "247+38"`  
Output: `2(47+38)`  
*Explanation: Parentheses are placed to yield 2 × (47 + 38) = 2 × 85 = 170, which is the minimal possible result.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `expression = "12+34"`  
Output: `1(2+34)`  
*Explanation: Parentheses are placed so 1 × (2 + 34) = 36. Other placements such as (12+3)4 would give 15 × 4 = 60 (not minimal).*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `expression = "99+999"`  
Output: `9(9+999)`  
*Explanation: Parentheses turn it into 9 × (9 + 999) = 9 × 1008 = 9072. No placement yields a lower value.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
The problem is to find the optimal place to insert a pair of parentheses (one before '+', one after '+') to minimize the total evaluation.  
- **Brute-force approach**:  
  Try all possible left parenthesis positions (anywhere in num₁, not after '+') and all possible right parenthesis positions (anywhere in num₂, not before '+'). For each partition, calculate the result using:  
  result = left_multiplier × (inside_sum) × right_multiplier  
  where the outside multipliers may be 1 (if the parenthesis is at the ends). Keep the string format that produces the smallest value.

- **Why brute-force is ok**:  
  num₁ and num₂ are both small (split at '+', each can be at most ~4-5 digits for normal test cases). So, for each character in num₁, try opening, and for each character in num₂, try closing—total O(length₁ × length₂) possibilities.

- **Trade-offs**:  
  This brute-force works efficiently and is easy to code because the number of possibilities is at most 49 for 7-digit numbers.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Both numbers are single digits
- Parentheses wrapped around the entire expression  
- Leading zeros in numbers  
- Extremely unequal lengths (e.g. 1+99999)  
- Same possible result for multiple placements—return any

### Solution

```python
def minimizeResult(expression: str) -> str:
    plus_idx = expression.index('+')
    left, right = expression[:plus_idx], expression[plus_idx+1:]
    min_value = float('inf')
    result = ""

    # Try every left-parenthesis position in 'left' (from 0 to len(left)-1)
    for l in range(len(left)):
        # Try every right-parenthesis position in 'right' (from 1 to len(right))
        for r in range(1, len(right)+1):
            # split both sides
            left_mul = int(left[:l]) if l > 0 else 1
            sum_left = int(left[l:])
            sum_right = int(right[:r])
            right_mul = int(right[r:]) if r < len(right) else 1

            total = left_mul * (sum_left + sum_right) * right_mul

            if total < min_value:
                min_value = total
                # construct the result string
                result = ''
                result += left[:l]                    # left multiplier (if any)
                result += '(' + left[l:] + '+'       # sum-part left
                result += right[:r] + ')'            # sum-part right
                result += right[r:]                  # right multiplier (if any)
    return result
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²) — n = total length of expression. For each left split (≤ len(left)), every right split (≤ len(right)). Each operation is O(1) string/int ops.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) — for result construction; inputs and temporary variables are all O(n).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the numbers are very large (won't fit in 32-bits)?
  *Hint: Can you avoid direct integer calculation, maybe by string manipulation?*

- How would you extend this logic for more than one '+' or for other operators?
  *Hint: Generalize to parsing/DP for expression evaluation.*

- Can you return all possible such expressions that yield the minimum result?
  *Hint: Store all placements when you see a value equal to the minimum.*

### Summary
This problem is a **string partitioning and simulation** challenge. The approach is a controlled brute-force using all split positions and evaluating each possibility, leveraging the small input size for efficiency. This "try all splits" strategy is common for parenthesis-placement, dynamic programming on partitions, and is useful in similar minimal/maximal expression problems.
