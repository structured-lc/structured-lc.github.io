### Leetcode 3208 (Medium): Alternating Groups II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/alternating-groups-ii)

### Description  
You are given a circle of red and blue tiles, represented as an array `colors`, where each entry is either 0 (red) or 1 (blue). Given an integer `k`, an **alternating group** is any k contiguous tiles in this circle where the colors alternate (that is, each tile—except the first and last—must be different from both its neighbors). Since the tiles form a circle, the first and last element are considered adjacent.  
The goal: **Count the number of distinct alternating groups of size k.**

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `colors = [0,1,0,1,0]`, `k = 3`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: There are 3 groups of size 3 with alternating colors: [0,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,1,0] (starting from indices 0, 1, and 2 in the circle).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `colors = [0,1,0,0,1,0,1]`, `k = 6`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: 2 circular groups of length 6 in which colors alternate. These start at indices 1 and 4.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `colors = [1,1,0,1]`, `k = 4`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: No group of length 4 alternates (there are at least two adjacent same colors in each possible group).*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- Brute force: try all possible k-length windows by “rotating” the array, check if all adjacent elements in a window alternate. Since the array is circular, wrap around with modulo.
- For each of the n possible starting points, check the k tiles: O(n×k).
- Optimization: For this problem (where n ≤ 105), brute force is acceptable, but if n were large, we’d optimize by noticing the alternating pattern—if we break at a same-color pair, we skip to the next possible window start after that break.
- Since n is small, clarity > premature micro-optimizations.  
- Deal with the circularity: extend the array by its first (k-1) elements, so every circular window becomes a straight window.

### Corner cases to consider  
- n = k (one window)  
- Repeated colors (all 0s, all 1s)  
- k = 3 (smallest valid k)  
- The wrap-around group (last (k-1) + first elements)  
- No possible windows (no alternation at all)

### Solution

```python
def alternatingGroupsII(colors, k):
    n = len(colors)
    result = 0
    # Extend colors to handle circularity
    extended = colors + colors[:k-1]
    # Try each possible window
    for start in range(n):
        valid = True
        for i in range(start, start + k - 1):
            if extended[i] == extended[i + 1]:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            result += 1
    return result
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n × k)  
  For n starting positions, for each, we check up to k-1 adjacent pairs.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n + k)  
  Creating the extended array costs O(n + k), otherwise just constant extra space.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if n is very large (e.g., millions)?  
  *Hint: Could you process without checking all windows from scratch each time?*

- Could you solve for non-binary colors (not just 0 and 1)?  
  *Hint: Is the check for alternation still just a pairwise comparison?*

- Can you output the starting indices of each alternating group?  
  *Hint: Collect those indices where the window passes validation.*

### Summary
This problem is a straightforward sliding window check where, for each possible window (accounting for circularity), we validate that the window alternates colors.  
The core idea—flattening circularity into a straight array with duplication—is a robust trick for many array/circle problems. The pairwise adjacency check is a standard pattern for alternation questions and appears in string processing and cycle detection problems.
