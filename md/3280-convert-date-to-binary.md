### Leetcode 3280 (Easy): Convert Date to Binary [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-date-to-binary)

### Description  
Given a string representing a date in the "yyyy-mm-dd" format, convert each of its year, month, and day components to their binary representations (without leading zeroes) and concatenate them with hyphens.  
For example, "2080-02-29" should become "100000100000-10-11101".  
This requires splitting the date, converting each part to an integer, then to binary (without the '0b' Python prefix), and finally joining them in the required format.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `"2080-02-29"`  
Output: `"100000100000-10-11101"`  
*Explanation: 2080₁₀ → 100000100000₂, 2₁₀ → 10₂, 29₁₀ → 11101₂.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `"1900-01-01"`  
Output: `"11101101100-1-1"`  
*Explanation: 1900₁₀ → 11101101100₂, 1₁₀ → 1₂, 1₁₀ → 1₂.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `"2024-12-31"`  
Output: `"111111001000-1100-11111"`  
*Explanation: 2024₁₀ → 111111001000₂, 12₁₀ → 1100₂, 31₁₀ → 11111₂.*


### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, I would extract each part of the date (year, month, day) by splitting the string on hyphens.  
Once separated, I convert each part from string to integer.  
Next, I'll convert each integer to its binary representation using manual implementation (since in interviews, built-ins like `bin()` may not always be encouraged) and strip leading zeros.  
Finally, I join the three binary strings with hyphens to create the final result.  
This approach is efficient since string parsing and integer to binary conversion are all O(1) for fixed size inputs, and the coding is straightforward.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Input where month or day is a single digit (e.g., "1900-01-01").
- Years on the boundary ("1900-01-01", "2100-12-31").
- Month or day is '10', '11', or '12' (to check two-digit decimal → binary).
- No leading zeros in output binaries.
- Valid dates according to Gregorian calendar guaranteed by constraints.


### Solution

```python
def convert_date_to_binary(date):
    # Split the date into year, month, day components
    year_str, month_str, day_str = date.split('-')
    
    # Helper to convert integer to binary string
    def int_to_binary(n):
        if n == 0:
            return '0'
        bits = []
        while n > 0:
            bits.append(str(n % 2))
            n //= 2
        return ''.join(reversed(bits))
    
    # Convert each part to int, then to binary string without leading zeroes
    year_bin = int_to_binary(int(year_str))
    month_bin = int_to_binary(int(month_str))
    day_bin = int_to_binary(int(day_str))
    
    # Join with hyphens
    return f"{year_bin}-{month_bin}-{day_bin}"
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(1), since the input is always in the form "yyyy-mm-dd" (fixed digit count), all operations are on small integers and string slices.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), using a few variables for the output and list for bits (max length of 12 for year binary).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the input format varies, e.g., "dd/mm/yyyy" or dates with single-digit months and days?
  *Hint: Consider string parsing flexibility or regex.*

- How would you extend this to convert a list of dates in a batch?
  *Hint: Use loops or map, handle exceptions for invalid values.*

- Can this be achieved using bitwise operations for conversion (without string manipulation)?
  *Hint: Explore bit manipulation to build the binary string from least to most significant bit.*

### Summary
This problem uses a **simple simulation and string parsing pattern**: break input into parts, perform a small calculation on each, and reassemble.  
The solution is direct, robust to constraints, and showcases basic string/integer handling. This pattern frequently appears in parsing and formatting problems, and is foundational to interview questions involving manual conversion or output transformation.
