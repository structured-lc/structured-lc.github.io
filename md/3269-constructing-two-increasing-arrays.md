### Leetcode 3269 (Hard): Constructing Two Increasing Arrays [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/constructing-two-increasing-arrays)

### Description  
Given two arrays of the same length, `nums1` and `nums2`, consisting only of `0`s and `1`s:
- Replace every `0` with a **distinct even positive integer** and every `1` with a **distinct odd positive integer** in both arrays.
- After replacement, both arrays must be strictly increasing.
- Find the minimum possible value of the largest element among the two resulting arrays.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums1 = [0,1,0], nums2 = [1,0,1]`  
Output: `7`  
*Explanation:  
One valid construction:  
nums1 = [2,3,4]  
nums2 = [1,6,7]  
Both arrays strictly increasing, evens/odds respected, max is 7 (minimal possible).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums1 = [1,1], nums2 = [1,1]`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation:  
Possible:  
nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2,5]  
Both strictly increasing, correct parity, max = 5.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums1 = , nums2 = [1]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:  
nums1 = [2], nums2 = [1]  
Only one in each, minimal required, max = 2.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- Brute-force:  
    - Generate all possible assignments for every zero and one, try all increasing replacements.  
    - Try all permutations of possible odd and even values, check all arrangements. This is clearly infeasible for n > 3 due to combinatorial explosion.

- Optimization:  
    - Since arrays must be strictly increasing and values must match parity, we want to use the *smallest possible* even/odd values for each new number, **ensuring no collisions between the two arrays**.
    - This suggests a DP or greedy construction:  
        - At each step, pick the minimal next even or odd, larger than the previous in the respective sequence.
        - However, since values can't be shared, we must coordinate assignments between the two arrays.

- **Dynamic Programming:**  
    - Let f[i][j] be the minimal maximal value to construct the first i of nums1 and first j of nums2, both increasing, following parity rules.
    - The transition:  
        - Place the next minimal valid value (even/odd as required) after f[i-1][j] or f[i][j-1].
        - Try both, pick the better one.

- Trade-offs:  
    - The DP has state (i,j) so O(m×n) time and space.  
    - No better than O(n²) possible for n up to hundreds.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All zeros or all ones in either array  
- Arrays of length 1  
- Alternating patterns (e.g., [0,1,0,1,...])  
- When one array is strictly smaller than the other  
- The two arrays having the same values in the same positions  
- Large n for efficiency

### Solution

```python
def minLargest(nums1, nums2):
    n = len(nums1)
    # DP table f[i][j]: minimal max value after filling i nums1 and j nums2
    # f[0][0] = 0; represents no elements picked yet
    f = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # Helper: given a prev number x and required parity (0=even,1=odd),
    # get smallest strictly greater integer with that parity
    def next_val(x, parity):
        # Start from x + 1, bump up to match parity
        res = x + 1
        if res % 2 != parity:
            res += 1
        return res

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        f[i][0] = next_val(f[i-1][0], nums1[i-1])
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        f[0][j] = next_val(f[0][j-1], nums2[j-1])

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            prev1 = next_val(f[i-1][j], nums1[i-1])
            prev2 = next_val(f[i][j-1], nums2[j-1])
            f[i][j] = min(prev1, prev2)
    return f[n][n]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²), as we fill an (n+1) × (n+1) DP table, and each step is O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n²), used for the DP table; negligible extra space outside this.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if both arrays could repeat numbers after replacements?  
  *Hint: How does the "strictly increasing" constraint interact with allowed duplicates?*

- What if zeros/ones could be replaced with any positive number, but each integer can only be used once globally?  
  *Hint: Assignment turns into a bipartite matching problem.*

- Can you generate *all* possible valid minimal-max-value assignments, not just the value?  
  *Hint: Trace all DP paths that lead to answer, enumerate all paths.*

### Summary
This problem is a dynamic programming state-space construction: at each point, pick the minimal next valid value with correct parity, avoiding overlap between arrays and ensuring strict increase. The DP "matrix-fill" pattern generalizes to similar problems involving parallel monotonic sequences with assignment constraints. This pattern is especially useful in scheduling/type-constrained sequence construction problems.
