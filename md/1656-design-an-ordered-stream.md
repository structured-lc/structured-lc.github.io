### Leetcode 1656 (Easy): Design an Ordered Stream [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-an-ordered-stream)

### Description  
Design a data stream to receive n (idKey, value) pairs, arriving in any order. Each idKey is a unique integer from 1 to n, and value is a string. After each insertion, return the largest possible list (chunk) of **consecutive, in-order values** starting from the earliest not-yet-returned id. The final result should be all values sorted by idKey.

Implement the following methods:
- `OrderedStream(int n)`: Initializes the stream.
- `insert(int idKey, String value)`: Inserts the pair and returns the next ordered chunk of values.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 5, insert(3, "cc"), insert(1, "aa"), insert(2, "bb")`  
Output: `[], ["aa"], ["bb", "cc"]`  
*Explanation: Nothing to return after inserting 3; after inserting 1, can return "aa"; after inserting 2, can now return whatever is consecutively ready ("bb" and "cc").*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 4, insert(2, "bb"), insert(4, "dd"), insert(3, "cc"), insert(1, "aa")`  
Output: `[], [], ["cc"], ["aa", "bb", "cc", "dd"]`  
*Explanation: Chunks released only when a sequence starting from pointer is formed.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
To efficiently implement insertions and in-order chunk retrievals, I would use an array of length n to store the values by index (idKey−1). I would maintain a pointer (starting at 0) to track the first not-yet-returned id. On insert, I place the value at (idKey−1). Then, as long as data at the pointer is filled, collect all consecutive values and advance the pointer. This guarantees O(1) amortized time as we never revisit indices.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Insertions out of order
- Insertions with idKey at the end first
- Only one value inserted
- All values missing except the first
- n = 1
- All insertions are in order

### Solution

```python
class OrderedStream:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        # Allocate list with n None values
        self.data = [None] * n
        # Pointer to next expected id (0-based)
        self.ptr = 0

    def insert(self, idKey: int, value: str) -> list[str]:
        # Insert value in proper spot
        self.data[idKey - 1] = value
        # Prepare the chunk to return
        chunk = []
        # Gather consecutive non-None values starting from self.ptr
        while self.ptr < len(self.data) and self.data[self.ptr] is not None:
            chunk.append(self.data[self.ptr])
            self.ptr += 1
        return chunk
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) amortized per insert, as each element is checked at most once when ptr advances.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the stored values.


### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you support removing pairs from the stream?
  *Hint: Consider impact on pointer logic and chunk returns.*

- What if duplicate idKey insertions are allowed?
  *Hint: Would need to reject/overwrite depending on requirements.*

- Can you implement without extra space, or if n is very large?
  *Hint: Trade space for an on-the-fly chunk search, but that could impact performance.*

### Summary
This problem demonstrates a classic pointer + array approach for streaming, in-order processing, and batching. This sliding pointer technique is applicable to problems like file chunking, event sequencing, and buffer flush strategies where data must be processed in order, but may arrive out-of-order.


### Flashcard
Use an array and a pointer to track the next chunk; insert at idKey−1, then collect all consecutive filled values from the pointer.
