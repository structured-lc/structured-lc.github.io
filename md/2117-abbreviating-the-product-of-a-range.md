### Leetcode 2117 (Hard): Abbreviating the Product of a Range [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/abbreviating-the-product-of-a-range)

### Description  
Given two integers, `left` and `right` (with left ≤ right), compute the product of all integers in the inclusive range \[left, right\]. Because this product could be extremely large, **abbreviate the result** as follows:
- **Count the number of trailing zeros** in the product (`C`). Remove these zeros.
- If the resulting number has **more than 10 digits**, represent it as:  
  `<first 5 digits>...<last 5 digits>eC`
- If it has **10 or fewer digits**, represent it as:  
  `<number>eC`
- Return this as a string.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `left = 1, right = 4`  
Output: `24e0`  
Explanation: 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24.  
There are no trailing zeros. Number of digits < 10, so simply: "24e0".

**Example 2:**  
Input: `left = 2, right = 11`  
Output: `399168e2`  
Explanation: Product is 39916800.  
There are 2 trailing zeros (remove and count), leaving 399168.  
6 digits < 10, so: "399168e2".

**Example 3:**  
Input: `left = 371, right = 375`  
Output: `7219856259e3`  
Explanation: Product is 7219856259000.  
3 trailing zeros (removed, so e3).  
Remaining digits = 10, so: "7219856259e3".

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
Brute-force:  
- Multiply all numbers from `left` to `right` directly and strip trailing zeros at the end.  
- This approach immediately fails for large ranges (product overflows integer range).

Optimizations:  
- **Count trailing zeros using factor counts:**  
  - Trailing zeros come from pairs of factors 2 & 5.  
  - Count the powers of 2 and 5 separately across the whole range.
- **Track the first and last few digits:**  
  - For the **prefix** (first digits): multiplying and trimming after, using floating point (logarithms).
  - For the **suffix** (last digits): multiply modulo a large power of 10 (ignore factors of 10 to manage trailing zeros as you go).
- **Avoid overflow:**  
  - Always control the number size for prefix (e.g., keep up to 12 significant digits), and for suffix (up to 10 digits).

Select this approach for efficiency and accuracy for larger `left`, `right`.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Range where left = right (only one number).
- Product is 0 (not possible here, since inputs are all positive).
- The number contains many zeros in the middle (but only trailing zeros count for abbreviation).
- The result after removing trailing zeros is exactly 10 digits (borderline abbreviation).
- When product has no trailing zeros.

### Solution

```python
def abbreviateProduct(left: int, right: int) -> str:
    import math

    # Constants for how many digits to keep
    prefixM = 10 ** 12  # Track enough prefix digits to avoid precision loss
    suffixM = 10 ** 10  # Track 10 suffix digits

    prefix, suffix, trailing = 1, 1, 0
    need_split = False

    count2, count5 = 0, 0

    # First pass: count all 2's and 5's in factors
    for x in range(left, right + 1):
        y = x
        while y % 2 == 0:
            count2 += 1
            y //= 2
        y = x
        while y % 5 == 0:
            count5 += 1
            y //= 5

    zeros = min(count2, count5)
    count2 -= zeros
    count5 -= zeros

    # Calculate prefix (leading digits)
    total_log = 0
    for x in range(left, right + 1):
        total_log += math.log10(x)
    total_log -= zeros * math.log10(10)
    prefix_digits = pow(10, total_log - int(total_log) + 4)  # 5 leading digits
    prefix_str = str(int(prefix_digits))
    if len(prefix_str) < 5:
        prefix_str = prefix_str.zfill(5)
    else:
        prefix_str = prefix_str[:5]

    # Calculate suffix
    suffix = 1
    for x in range(left, right + 1):
        y = x
        # Remove 2's and 5's as per above
        for p, cnt in [(2, count2), (5, count5)]:
            while cnt > 0 and y % p == 0:
                y //= p
                cnt -= 1
        suffix = (suffix * y) % suffixM

    # Now add back any leftover 2's and 5's
    suffix = (suffix * pow(2, count2, suffixM)) % suffixM
    suffix = (suffix * pow(5, count5, suffixM)) % suffixM

    suffix_str = str(suffix)
    # Remove necessary zeros (trailing)
    suffix_temp = suffix
    t = 0
    while suffix_temp and suffix_temp % 10 == 0:
        suffix_temp //= 10
        t += 1

    suffix_str = str(suffix_temp)
    if len(suffix_str) > 5:
        suffix_str = suffix_str[-5:]
    else:
        suffix_str = suffix_str.zfill(5)

    # Figure actual number of digits without abbreviated zeros
    total_digits = int(total_log) + 1
    num_zeros = zeros

    if total_digits > 10:
        return f"{prefix_str}...{suffix_str}e{num_zeros}"
    else:
        # For small numbers, calculate the product directly
        prod = 1
        for x in range(left, right + 1):
            prod *= x
        s = str(prod)
        t = 0
        while s.endswith('0'):
            s = s[:-1]
            t += 1
        return f"{s}e{t}"
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) for n = right - left + 1. Each number in range is processed for log calculations, factor divisions, prefix/suffix updates.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), extra space does not grow with input size (apart from variables for factors and calculations).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you extend this method if the range could contain negative numbers?  
  *Hint: Consider impact on sign and trailing zeros.*

- How would this change for a streaming data scenario, where numbers are coming in on-the-fly?  
  *Hint: Product, division and zero management need to be incremental and stable.*

- Can you generalize this approach for the product of an arbitrary list of numbers, not a range?  
  *Hint: You cannot use ranges' properties. Treat each element separately for factorization and product.*

### Summary
This problem uses number theory (factor counts for 2, 5) and floating-point logarithms to accurately manage and abbreviate very large products. The **pattern combines digit tracking, modulo arithmetic, and factor counting**, a classic in handling big numbers for factorial-like products in interviews.  
This digit-abbreviation pattern can be applied in any scenario where full products are too large to represent directly, such as high precision statistics, factorials, and combinatorics.


### Flashcard
Count total factors of 2 and 5 for trailing zeros; use logarithms for prefix digits and modular multiplication for suffix digits to avoid overflow.
