### Leetcode 3571 (Easy): Find the Shortest Superstring II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-shortest-superstring-ii)

### Description  
Given two strings s₁ and s₂, return the **shortest possible string** that contains both s₁ and s₂ as substrings. If there are several answers with the minimum length, return any one of them. Both strings only consist of lowercase English letters.

This means, you're asked to "merge" two strings by overlapping as much as possible, so that both appear as substrings, and the result is as short as possible.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s1 = "aba"`, `s2 = "bab"`  
Output: `"abab"`  
*Explanation: "abab" contains both "aba" (from idx 0) and "bab" (from idx 1), and is the shortest possible such string.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s1 = "aa"`, `s2 = "aaa"`  
Output: `"aaa"`  
*Explanation: "aa" is already a substring of "aaa". The shortest superstring is "aaa".*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s1 = "abc"`, `s2 = "bca"`  
Output: `"abca"`  
*Explanation: "abc" (from idx 0) and "bca" (from idx 1) both appear as substrings. Overlap is "bc".*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First instinct:  
- Brute-force all possible overlaps (including zero), append suffix or prefix to cover the rest.
- There are two main cases:
  - s₂ *already* appears as a substring in s₁, or vice versa: just return the longer one.
  - Otherwise, find the maximum possible overlap—i.e., largest suffix of s₁ equal to prefix of s₂, or vice versa.
- For overlap, slide s₂ over s₁ (suffix-to-prefix), and s₁ over s₂ (suffix-to-prefix), check the largest matching region.

Optimal approach:
- Check the largest suffix of s₁ that matches the prefix of s₂.
- Also, check the largest suffix of s₂ that matches the prefix of s₁.
- Compare the two resulting merged strings, return the shorter (or either if equal).

Trade-offs:
- This approach runs in O(n²) time (n = max(len(s₁), len(s₂))), but with both ≤100, this is very efficient.
- Space is negligible and easy to code.

### Corner cases to consider  
- One string is a substring of another.
- No overlap at all (e.g. s₁ = "abc", s₂ = "def").
- Full overlap (e.g. s₁ = "aaa", s₂ = "aaa").
- Overlap at multiple places—choose maximum overlap.
- s₁ or s₂ is length 1.
- Both strings are identical.

### Solution

```python
def shortestSuperstring(s1: str, s2: str) -> str:
    # Check if s1 contains s2 or vice versa
    if s2 in s1:
        return s1
    if s1 in s2:
        return s2

    # Find max overlap where s1's suffix matches s2's prefix
    max_overlap1 = 0
    min_len = min(len(s1), len(s2))
    for l in range(min_len, 0, -1):
        if s1[-l:] == s2[:l]:
            max_overlap1 = l
            break

    # Find max overlap where s2's suffix matches s1's prefix
    max_overlap2 = 0
    for l in range(min_len, 0, -1):
        if s2[-l:] == s1[:l]:
            max_overlap2 = l
            break

    # Build possible merged results
    candidate1 = s1 + s2[max_overlap1:]
    candidate2 = s2 + s1[max_overlap2:]

    # Return the shorter one, or either if both equal length
    if len(candidate1) <= len(candidate2):
        return candidate1
    else:
        return candidate2
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(N²), where N is max(len(s₁), len(s₂)), since overlap search may compare up to N characters for each overlap direction.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), since we construct strings of size up to 2N in the worst case.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you extend your solution to more than two strings?
  *Hint: Look into dynamic programming and bitmasking, similar to traveling salesman problem for merging strings with max overlap.*

- How would you efficiently check for string containment or overlap for large N?
  *Hint: Use advanced string matching (like KMP or Z-algorithm) if substring search becomes slow.*

- If the inputs could be very long, how would you optimize memory usage?
  *Hint: Avoid making unnecessary copies; use pointers or indices when possible.*

### Summary
This problem uses the **string overlap pattern**—finding maximal matching edges to compress two strings into their shortest common superstring. The brute-force tries all overlaps, but optimized approaches just check prefix/suffix equality in both directions. This is a special case of the more general shortest superstring problem (which for >2 strings is much harder, using dynamic programming and bitmasking). Similar patterns appear in sequence assembly (bioinformatics), spell correction, and file merging.
