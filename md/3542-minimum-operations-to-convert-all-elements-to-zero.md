### Leetcode 3542 (Medium): Minimum Operations to Convert All Elements to Zero [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-convert-all-elements-to-zero)

### Description  
Given an array of non-negative integers, you want to convert all the elements to zero using a minimum number of operations. In one operation, you can select any subarray (continuous segment) and set **all occurrences of the minimum value within that subarray** to zero. You want to find the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array zero.

Think of this as picking any contiguous group and, in a single move, erasing all copies of its (current) minimum. Repeat until nothing but zeros remain.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [0,2]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Select the subarray [2] (indices 1-1), its min is 2. Set it to zero.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [3,1,2,1]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:*
- Select indices 1-1: min=1, set index 1 to zero → [3,0,2,1]
- Select indices 3-3: min=1, set index 3 to zero → [3,0,2,0]
- Select indices 0-2: min=2, set index 2 to zero → [3,0,0,0]
- Select indices 0-0: min=3, set index 0 to zero → [0,0,0,0]
But notice: if you pick indices 1-3, min=1—so one op zeros both 1s. Then op 0-2 for 2, then 0-0 for 3. That’s 3 total.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: Each distinct value needs a separate operation—1→0, then 2→0, then 3→0, then 4→0. You can't erase more than one value at a time as every min is unique and occurs once.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
Start with brute-force: Try all possible subarrays, erase their min, repeat. This is exponential and not feasible.

Key observation: You can only erase *all* occurrences of the minimum in your chosen range, and to be optimal you should erase as many duplicates of a value as possible in a single operation. If you partition the array into contiguous blocks of non-zero values, in each such block you can erase the smallest value in one operation, and repeat for the rest.

So, the better approach is:
- Split the array at zeros, producing contiguous non-zero intervals.
- For each interval, recursively apply the same operation: 
    - Count 1 for clearing the min in this segment, then "recurse" on the resulting subsegments from the split points created after those mins are zeroed.
- For any interval, the answer is min(length of the interval, clearing by min + solving subsegments).

This is a variant of a greedy + divide & conquer approach, somewhat similar to painting or pruning problems.

**Tradeoffs:**  
The divide & conquer ensures minimal redundancy. It’s much faster than brute-forcing all possible subarrays. This approach is scalable for larger inputs.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All zeros already (needs 0 operations)
- Array of one element (either 0 or nonzero)
- All elements equal (should take 1 operation)
- Multiple separated zeros (multiple blocks)
- Large values: algorithm must not depend on the value size
- Very large arrays: recursion or stack overhead

### Solution

```python
def min_operations(nums):
    def helper(l, r):
        # Find the next block of non-zero elements within nums[l:r]
        i = l
        res = 0
        while i < r:
            if nums[i] == 0:
                i += 1
                continue
            # Start of non-zero segment
            j = i
            while j < r and nums[j] != 0:
                j += 1
            # Now nums[i:j] is a maximal nonzero segment
            min_val = min(nums[i:j])
            res += min_val
            # Subtract min_val from each element in nums[i:j]
            for k in range(i, j):
                nums[k] -= min_val
            # Recurse on nums[i:j] (which now may have new zeros)
            res += helper(i, j)
            i = j
        return res
        
    return helper(0, len(nums))
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²) in the worst case—at each level, potentially scanning the entire remaining segment; for all possible splits and recursions. For well-spaced zeros, much less.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) from recursion stack in the worst case (if all elements are distinct and nonzero, leading to deep recursion); the array is updated in-place, so no significant extra storage.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if instead of setting to zero, you could set min to any other chosen value?
  *Hint: How would the recurrence or greedy policy change?*

- How might this change if you could only select subarrays of a fixed length k?
  *Hint: Now the greedy step becomes trickier: you might need dynamic programming.*

- Can you make your solution iterative instead of recursive for very large arrays?
  *Hint: Transform divide & conquer to stack-based processing.*

### Summary
This divide-and-conquer pruning pattern is classic in range segment manipulation problems, similar to some advanced DP, greedy, and "painting" problems. The optimal strategy here is to recursively clear minimal values from each contiguous non-zero segment, counting the operations and splitting at zero boundaries. This approach is applicable in any problem where you must greedily eliminate repeated "obstacles" in intervals and handle subintervals recursively.
