### Leetcode 1822 (Easy): Sign of the Product of an Array [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array)

### Description  
You are given an integer array nums. Return 1 if the product of all elements is positive, -1 if the product is negative, and 0 if the product is zero. You don't need to calculate the actual product value, just determine its sign.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,3,2,1]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Product = (-1) × (-2) × (-3) × (-4) × 3 × 2 × 1 = 144, which is positive.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1,5,0,2,-3]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: Product contains 0, so result is 0.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [-1,1,-1,1,-1]`  
Output: `-1`  
*Explanation: Product = (-1) × 1 × (-1) × 1 × (-1) = -1, which is negative.*

### Thought Process (as if you're the interviewee)  
This problem is about determining the sign without computing the actual product, which could cause integer overflow.

Key insights:
1. **Zero handling**: If any element is 0, the product is 0
2. **Sign rules**: The sign depends only on the count of negative numbers
   - Even count of negatives → positive product
   - Odd count of negatives → negative product
3. **No need for actual multiplication**: Just count negative numbers

My approach:
1. **Early termination**: Return 0 immediately if any element is 0
2. **Count negatives**: Track how many negative numbers exist
3. **Determine sign**: Use parity of negative count

### Corner cases to consider  
- Array containing zero
- All positive numbers
- All negative numbers (even vs odd count)
- Single element array
- Array with mix of positive, negative, and zero
- Very large numbers (but we don't compute product)

### Solution

```python
def arraySign(nums):
    negative_count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if num == 0:
            return 0
        elif num < 0:
            negative_count += 1
    
    # If even number of negatives, product is positive
    # If odd number of negatives, product is negative
    return 1 if negative_count % 2 == 0 else -1
```

Alternative concise solution:

```python
def arraySign(nums):
    sign = 1
    
    for num in nums:
        if num == 0:
            return 0
        elif num < 0:
            sign *= -1
    
    return sign
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the array, as we need to examine each element once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space for counting or tracking sign.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you're the interviewer)  

- How would you handle very large arrays that don't fit in memory?  
  *Hint: Process the array in chunks or use streaming approach, maintaining running count of negatives.*

- What if you needed to return the actual product value as well?  
  *Hint: Use big integer libraries or handle overflow detection, though the sign logic remains the same.*

- Can you solve this without using modulo operator?  
  *Hint: Use the alternating sign approach where you flip sign for each negative number encountered.*

### Summary
This problem demonstrates the mathematical principle that the sign of a product depends only on the count of negative factors, not their actual values. It's an excellent example of optimization by avoiding unnecessary computation (actual multiplication) and focusing on the essential property (sign). This pattern appears in problems involving mathematical properties, overflow avoidance, and logical reasoning about numerical operations.


### Flashcard
Count negative numbers in array; return 0 if any zero exists, else return −1 if odd negatives, +1 if even negatives.
