### Leetcode 1863 (Easy): Sum of All Subset XOR Totals [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-all-subset-xor-totals)

### Description  
Given an array nums, find the sum of the XOR totals for all subsets of nums. The XOR total of a subset is the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the subset is empty. You need to iterate through all possible subsets, compute each subset’s XOR, and sum these values. For example, if the input is [1, 3], you need to consider all subsets: [], [1], [3], [1,3], and sum their XOR totals (0, 1, 3, 2) to get 6.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input=[1, 3]  
Output=6  
Explanation: Subsets are [], [1], [3], [1,3]. XOR totals are 0, 1, 3, 2. Sum is 0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.

**Example 2:**  
Input=[5, 1, 6]  
Output=28  
Explanation: All subsets: [], [5], [1], , [5,1], [5,6], [1,6], [5,1,6]. XOR totals: 0, 5, 1, 6, 5 XOR 1 = 4, 5 XOR 6 = 3, 1 XOR 6 = 7, 5 XOR 1 XOR 6 = 2. Sum is 0 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 28.

**Example 3:**  
Input=[1, 2, 3]  
Output=12  
Explanation: All 8 subsets: [], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]. XOR totals: 0, 1, 2, 3, 1 XOR 2 = 3, 1 XOR 3 = 2, 2 XOR 3 = 1, 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0. Sum is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 12.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
Start with the brute-force idea: generate all possible subsets, compute their XOR totals, and sum them. For each element, you have two choices: include or exclude. This naturally fits a recursive DFS or backtracking approach, where you build up the current subset as you go.

The time complexity is O(2ⁿ) because there are 2ⁿ subsets for n elements, and you do a XOR for each subset.

This is correct but inefficient for large n because 2ⁿ grows very quickly. Is there a smarter way? For some problems, bitmask tricks or bitwise patterns allow O(n) or O(1) solutions, but for this, the straightforward DFS is clear and sufficient for the given constraints.

The final approach is recursive DFS, because it’s intuitive, clean, and easy to explain. For large n, interviewers might ask for optimizations, but here the trade-off is between clarity and speed: speed is not the main concern for small n typical of interview questions.

### Corner cases to consider  

- Empty array: just the empty subset, sum is 0.
- Single element: subsets are [] and [x], sum is 0 + x = x.
- All elements equal: XOR totals may repeat; for [2,2], subsets are [], [2], [2], [2,2]. XOR totals are 0, 2, 2, 0. Sum is 4.
- Large n: even if n is small (n ≤ 12), code must work, but for n > 20, DFS would be too slow—though not required for this problem.

### Solution

```python
def subsetXORSum(nums):
    def dfs(index, current_xor):
        # When we reach the end, add the current XOR
        if index == len(nums):
            return current_xor
        # For each element, two choices: include or exclude
        # Add XOR of both choices
        return dfs(index + 1, current_xor ^ nums[index]) + dfs(index + 1, current_xor)
    
    return dfs(0, 0)
```

**Comments:**
- **Index** keeps track of the current element in the array.
- **current_xor** builds the XOR total as we go.
- **Base case:** When all elements are processed, add the final XOR value.
- **Include/Exclude:** For each element, accumulate the XORs from both choices.
- **No shortcuts:** Uses standard recursion, no special libraries.

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(2ⁿ), because for each of the n elements, we do two recursive calls, leading to 2ⁿ total calls.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), because of the recursion stack, which goes up to depth n (number of elements in the array). There’s no extra storage for subsets; everything is computed on the fly.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

How would you solve this if the problem asked for the product of all subset XOR totals instead of the sum?  
Hint: Think about how XOR and product interact with inclusion/exclusion.

Is there a way to solve this with a mathematical formula, avoiding explicit subset generation?  
Hint: Consider how each bit’s appearance affects the overall sum, and see if a pattern emerges.

How would you modify this code to report all subsets with a specific XOR total (e.g., all subsets with XOR = 4)?  
Hint: Instead of summing, collect subsets. This is a classic backtracking problem with a filter condition.

### Summary

This problem is about generating all subsets of an array, computing the XOR total for each, and summing them. The chosen solution uses DFS/backtracking to explore all subsets, tracking the current XOR total. This pattern—building all subsets recursively—is common in many combinatorial problems. The approach is efficient for small input sizes and showcases recursion and bitwise manipulation, important topics for technical interviews.
