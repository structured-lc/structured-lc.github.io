### Leetcode 1977 (Hard): Number of Ways to Separate Numbers [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-separate-numbers)

### Description  
Given a string representing a sequence of concatenated positive integers, count how many ways it can be split into a list of integers such that:
- Each integer is **positive** (i.e., has no leading zeros).
- The resulting list is **non-decreasing** (i.e., each later number is at least as large as any previous).
Return the answer **modulo 10⁹+7**.

---

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `num = "327"`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation:  
You can split as either [3, 27] or  (both lists are non-decreasing and have no leading zeros).

**Example 2:**  
Input: `num = "094"`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation:  
All numbers must be positive and can't have leading zeros, so no valid way.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `num = "0"`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation:  
No positive number can start with zero.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute-force idea:**  
  Try all possible splits and check for validity (no leading zeros, non-decreasing order). But for length up to 3500, this would be too slow.

- **Dynamic Programming optimization:**  
  - Let dp[i] be the number of ways to split num[:i] into a valid sequence.
  - At each position, try all possible previous split points j; for each, check if num[j:i] is valid and ≥ previous number.
  - However, to compare substrings (possibly long numbers) efficiently, use a precalculated **Longest Common Prefix (LCP)** table, so that substring order comparison is \(O(1)\) instead of O(n).
  - Precompute LCP by iterating backwards through pairs (i, j), recording the length of the common prefix between num[i:] and num[j:].

- **Why pick this approach:**  
  DP is necessary for performance, but direct substring comparison is too slow; LCP brings this to within time limits. No better method for guaranteed correctness due to arbitrary (large) numbers.

### Corner cases to consider  
- num starts with '0' (immediate invalid)
- Internal segments in splits start with '0'
- All digits are in increasing order (must allow grouping in various lengths)
- All digits are the same (must allow many groupings)
- Only one digit
- Full string is a single number (possibly the only valid way)
- Repeated patterns (to test substring comparison logic)

### Solution

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def numberOfCombinations(num: str) -> int:
    n = len(num)
    if num[0] == '0':
        return 0

    # Precompute LCP: lcp[i][j] is the length of the longest common prefix of num[i:] and num[j:]
    lcp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if num[i] == num[j]:
                lcp[i][j] = lcp[i+1][j+1] + 1

    # Helper to determine if num[i:i+k] >= num[j:j+k]
    def geq(i, j, k):
        l = lcp[i][j]
        if l >= k:
            return True
        if i+l == n or j+l == n:
            return False
        return num[i+l] > num[j+l]

    dp = [ [0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1) ]  # dp[i][k]: number of ways to partition first i digits, ending with segment of length k
    prefix = [ [0]*(n+2) for _ in range(n+1) ]  # prefix sums for fast range sum: prefix[i][k] = sum(dp[i][1..k])

    # Initialize base dp
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        if num[0] != '0':
            dp[k][k] = 1
            prefix[k][k] = 1

    # Main DP
    for i in range(1, n):
        for k in range(1, n-i+1):
            if num[i] == '0':
                break  # leading zero not allowed
            j = i - k
            res = 0
            if j < 0:
                continue
            # If previous number length k
            if num[j] != '0' and geq(j, i, k):
                res += dp[i][k]
            # or previous number length k-1 or less
            res += prefix[i][k-1]
            dp[i+k][k] = res % MOD
            prefix[i+k][k] = (prefix[i+k][k-1] + dp[i+k][k]) % MOD

    # Sum all ways to split using any last number length
    ans = 0
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        ans = (ans + dp[n][k]) % MOD
    return ans
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²), because:
  - Calculating LCP for all (i, j) pairs is O(n²).
  - The main DP loop potentially iterates O(n²) subproblems.
  - Substring comparisons are made O(1) by using LCP.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n²) for storing the DP table and the LCP array.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the numbers could be strictly increasing instead of non-decreasing?  
  *Hint: Only allow new segment if it’s strictly greater than previous. Tweak comparison logic.*

- How would you handle very large input strings (e.g., n > 10,000)?  
  *Hint: Can you reduce space usage, or optimize by only keeping necessary previous computations?*

- What if leading zeros are allowed?  
  *Hint: Remove the leading zero check, but be careful how it could affect valid counting.*

### Summary
This problem is a **DP with substring comparison** challenge. It utilizes a classic dynamic programming approach, but is made feasible by precalculating the **Longest Common Prefix (LCP)** table so number comparisons between segments are O(1) regardless of their length. This pattern—combining DP with string precomputations—arises in advanced string parsing, cryptographic protocols, or any case where “split and compare” is required.
