### Leetcode 2143 (Hard): Choose Numbers From Two Arrays in Range [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/choose-numbers-from-two-arrays-in-range)

### Description  
Given two 0-indexed integer arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of length n, find the number of _balanced ranges_ [l, r].  
A range [l, r] is **balanced** if for every index i in [l, r], you pick either nums1[i] or nums2[i] such that **the sum of all selected nums1 equals the sum of selected nums2**.  
Specifics:
- For each i in [l, r], you must pick one: nums1[i] or nums2[i].
- Sums are both considered 0 if you pick nothing.
- Ranges are considered different if their
  - (a) start/end (l ≠ l₂ or r ≠ r₂), or
  - (b) at any i, in one you pick nums1[i] but in the other you pick nums2[i].
Return the count _modulo 10⁹ + 7_.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums1=[1,2,3], nums2=[2,3,1]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Only the range [0,2] can be balanced (pick 1 from nums1, 3 from nums2, 1 from nums2: (1)+(3)+(1)=5 in total for nums1 choices, and (2)+(2)+(3)=7 in total for nums2 choices. But step by step: (choose carefully) — try all combinations; for this input, just one balanced range exists where you can pick for [0,2]: pick nums1=1, nums2[1]=3, nums1[2]=3. Both sums are 4 (1+3=4, 2+2=4).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums1=[0,0], nums2=[0,0]`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation: Every subrange is balanced: [0,0], [0,1], [1,1] (and for each range, every pick combination works since all values are zero; there are 6 ways total).*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums1=[1,1,1], nums2=[1,1,1]`  
Output: `12`  
*Explanation: Over ranges [0,0], [1,1], [2,2], [0,1], [1,2], [0,2], every combination gives equal sum, so every possible pick is valid. There are 2^(range length) pickings per range, so total balanced pickings: 1 + 1 + 1 (singles) + 2 + 2 + 4 = 11.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force approach:**  
  Try every possible range [l, r]. For each, try every picking for positions in [l, r] (2^(r-l+1) choices), checking if the sum picked from nums1 equals that from nums2.
  - This is O(n³·2ⁿ): far too slow.
- **Key insight:**  
  For a fixed range [l, r], the core is: at each i, pick either nums1[i] or nums2[i]. For each picking, count the difference of sums — want both sums equal.  
  That is, for each combination, the total delta = sum(picked from nums1) - sum(picked from nums2) == 0.
- **Better:**  
  For each possible [l, r], we can use DP for subset sum with difference.
  - Re-frame: For every position, choosing nums1[i] means add (nums1[i] - nums2[i]) to res and add nums2[i] to extra.
  - Instead, define delta[i] = nums1[i] - nums2[i]. For each range, count how many assignments of 0/1 to the positions in [l, r] sum to zero delta.
  - Use a hashmap to store ways to reach a certain "delta sum" in the current range; start from l to r, DP on possible delta sums.
- **DP design:**  
  For each [l, r], initialize a counter for {0:1}, then for each k in [l, r], for each existing sum in the dict, update new counts based on picking nums1[k] or nums2[k].
  - The answer is the sum of dict for all [l, r], since "total delta 0" means balanced.
- **Complexity:**  
  This is O(n²·S), S depends on nums1/2 value range (tight for reasonable constraints).

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty array (n=0): should return 0.
- All values zero (all combinations are balanced).
- One element case.
- All elements equal.
- Large absolute values causing big delta sums.
- Cases where it's impossible to balance (e.g. nums1 ≠ nums2 always).

### Solution

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def count_subranges(nums1, nums2):
    n = len(nums1)
    ans = 0

    # For each possible range [l, r]
    for l in range(n):
        # dp maps balance sum -> count of ways
        dp = {0: 1}
        for r in range(l, n):
            nxt = {}
            d = nums1[r] - nums2[r]
            # For each ongoing balance sum,
            # try picking nums1[r] or nums2[r]
            for bal, cnt in dp.items():
                # pick nums1[r], increases balance by d
                nxt[bal + d] = (nxt.get(bal + d, 0) + cnt) % MOD
                # pick nums2[r], balance unchanged
                nxt[bal] = (nxt.get(bal, 0) + cnt) % MOD
            dp = nxt
            # Count ways where (sum(nums1 picks) == sum(nums2 picks))
            # i.e., balance == 0
            ans = (ans + dp.get(0, 0)) % MOD
    return ans
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²·S), where S is the sum of possible \|nums1[i] - nums2[i]\| over a range (since number of possible balances is limited by value range).
- **Space Complexity:** O(S), for the DP counter (dict) per subrange. No recursion; storage scales with value spread of deltas.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if nums1 and nums2 could be very large (big values)?  
  *Hint: Is there any way to optimize the DP state representation or compress the delta sums?*

- Can you optimize for space across all subarrays?  
  *Hint: Is there any re-use among subarrays, i.e., using prefix balances?*

- How would your solution adapt if you must also output the ranges / pickings, not just count them?  
  *Hint: Consider reconstructing paths or keeping parents for each DP.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic example of dynamic programming with subarray/subsequence enumeration and map-based subset sum DP. The final approach leverages tracking all possible balance sums efficiently via hash maps and updating as we grow each subrange. This pattern can apply in problems involving subset sums with "either-or" decisions over ranges, especially when the subset property is "sum to target"/"balance", and is a variation of the classic subset sum problem.
