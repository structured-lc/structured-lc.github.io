### Leetcode 1578 (Medium): Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful)

### Description  
Given a string colors, where each character represents the color of a rope, and an array neededTime where neededTime[i] is the time to remove the iᵗʰ rope. You must remove the minimum number of ropes so that no two adjacent ropes have the same color. Return the minimum total removal time required.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `colors = "abaac"`, `neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Remove the second 'a' in the sequence (index 2), time = 3. Now adjacent have unique colors.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `colors = "abc"`, `neededTime = [1,2,3]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: Already colorful. No removal needed.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `colors = "aabaa"`, `neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Remove either 0 and 4, total time = 1+1 = 2, or remove second 'a' at index 1, time = 2. The optimal way is to remove the one with lowest neededTime in each consecutive 'a' segment except the one with highest time.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

The problem reduces to, for each group of consecutive same-color ropes, remove all but one rope (the one with highest neededTime) with least total cost. So, we scan the string, and whenever two or more of the same color are consecutive, we always keep the highest-cost rope and remove the rest (greedy). Add up the removal time for the others in each run.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All colors unique (need no removal).
- All same colors (keep only one, remove others).
- neededTime can have duplicates or same value for multiple ropes.

### Solution

```python
def minCost(colors, neededTime):
    total = 0
    max_time = 0
    for i in range(len(colors)):
        if i > 0 and colors[i] == colors[i - 1]:
            # remove the one with smaller neededTime
            total += min(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1])
            # to ensure correct max_time if run > 2, max_time always tracks current run's max time
            neededTime[i] = max(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1])
    return total
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) — single scan with O(1) work per element.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), reusing input list for state.


### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Can you solve if allowed to remove any number of ropes anywhere (not just consecutive)?
  *Hint: Try to maximize the size of the colorful rope.*
- What if each color group needs to have at least two consecutive of the same color left?
  *Hint: Greedily keep the highest, but adjust for new rule.*
- What if you need to return the indices of the ropes to remove?
  *Hint: Track which has minimal neededTime in the runs.*

### Summary
This is a greedy pattern commonly seen in array run removal/selection problems. For each consecutive group, we optimize locally by only keeping the maximum-valued element and summing removals for the rest. Pattern applies when you need to minimize cost when keeping only one of several repeated elements.
