### Leetcode 3145 (Hard): Find Products of Elements of Big Array [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-products-of-elements-of-big-array)

### Description  
You are given multiple queries. Each query contains three integers: `left`, `right`, and `mod`.  
There's a virtual array `bignums`, where each element is a power of two, chosen so that for every positive integer, its "powerful array" is the shortest array of powers of two (with possible repeats) summing up to that integer (i.e., a representation using powers of two).  
For each query, compute the product of `bignums[left] × bignums[left+1] × ... × bignums[right] % mod`.  

The array is virtual and huge, so direct computation isn't feasible; instead, we must leverage patterns in how the array is constructed.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `queries = [[0, 2, 1000]]`  
Output: `32`  
*Explanation: Suppose the first three elements are [1, 2, 8]: 1 = 2⁰, 2 = 2¹, 8 = 2³, powers = [0,1,3]. The sum of exponents = 0+1+3=4, so result is 2⁴ = 16.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `queries = [[1, 3, 10]]`  
Output: `8`  
*Explanation: Pick elements at indices 1–3, get their exponents, sum, raise 2 to that sum mod 10.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `queries = [[0, 0, 7], [1, 4, 10]]`  
Output: `[1, 6]`  
*Explanation:  
- Query 1: only element 1 = 2⁰, so 2⁰ = 1.  
- Query 2: Indices 1 to 4, sum up exponents, compute 2^{sum} % 10 = 6.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
To approach this problem, I first realize that building the actual array is too slow and memory-intensive for large queries.  
Instead, I need a way to determine, for any subrange [left, right], the sum of the exponents (i.e., the powers of 2 used in the powerful array representation).  
Since every "bignums" element is a power of 2, and their exponents can be systematically calculated, I need a fast way to compute the total sum of exponents in the range.  
The key is that the sum of exponents for bignums[0...k-1] can be computed with a helper function.  
For each query, the sum of exponents from left to right is: sumExponents(right+1) - sumExponents(left). The answer is then 2^{that sum} modulo mod. This leverages prefix sum ideas over a virtual powerful array and fast exponentiation for modulo.  
This approach is efficient and avoids memory issues.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Queries with left == right (single element).
- Queries where mod = 1 (always return 0).
- Zero or negative numbers in queries (should not happen per constraints).
- Large mod values (test for integer overflow in exponentiation).
- Multiple queries with overlapping or large ranges.

### Solution

```python
def findProductsOfElements(queries):
    # Helper function that computes the prefix sum of exponents for bignums[0..x-1]
    def sum_exponents(k):
        res = 0
        n = 0
        cnt1 = 0
        sumI = 0
        for i in range(63, 0, -1):
            c = (cnt1 << i) + (i << (i - 1))
            if c <= k:
                k -= c
                res += (sumI << i) + (i * (i - 1) // 2 << (i - 1))
                sumI += i
                cnt1 += 1
                n |= 1 << i
        if cnt1 <= k:
            k -= cnt1
            res += sumI
            n += 1
        while k > 0:
            # Number of trailing zeros in n
            tz = (n & -n).bit_length() - 1
            res += tz
            n &= n - 1
            k -= 1
        return res

    def mod_pow(a, n, mod):
        result = 1 % mod
        a = a % mod
        while n > 0:
            if n & 1:
                result = (result * a) % mod
            a = (a * a) % mod
            n >>= 1
        return result

    ans = []
    for left, right, mod in queries:
        # Compute exponents sum for range
        po = sum_exponents(right + 1) - sum_exponents(left)
        ans.append(mod_pow(2, po, mod))
    return ans

```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(Q × logN), where Q = number of queries, N is up to 2⁶³ (since we iterate 63 bits for each sum_exponents call). Each query is processed in about O(logN) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(Q) for the output array and O(1) extra—no large arrays or recursion, just variables.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the array elements were not all powers of 2?
  *Hint: Can you generalize the prefix sum idea for arbitrary sequences?*

- How would you handle updating values in this virtual array?
  *Hint: What kind of data structure is needed for range updates and range queries?*

- Can you support queries with variable bases instead of 2?
  *Hint: Adjust the exponent logic to the new base and see if math properties remain.*

### Summary
This problem exemplifies the pattern of virtual array manipulation using prefix sums, clever coding for sums over positional binary structure, and fast modular exponentiation. It's a common pattern where array size constraints force indirect computation via formula or bit manipulation—inspired by binary indexed trees and prefix sums in virtual or compressed domains. This pattern is applicable in problems requiring aggregate operations over very large or infinite virtual structures.
