### Leetcode 3645 (Medium): Maximum Total from Optimal Activation Order [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-from-optimal-activation-order)

### Description  
You are given two integer arrays, **value** and **limit**, both of length n. Initially, all elements are **inactive**. You can activate the elements in any order. To activate the element at index i, the number of currently active elements must be **strictly less than** limit[i]. When you activate i, you add value[i] to your total.  
After each activation, all elements j where limit[j] ≤ number of active elements become **permanently inactive** and can never be activated.  
Return the maximum total sum you can achieve by choosing the optimal activation order.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `value = [3,5,8]`, `limit = [2,1,3]`  
Output: `11`  
*Explanation: Activate index 2 first (limit 3, value 8, active count = 1). Then activate index 0 (limit 2, value 3, active count = 2). Index 1 would require active count < limit (1), but now active count is 2, so it cannot be activated. Total = 8 + 3 = 11.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `value = [5,6,1]`, `limit = [3,2,1]`  
Output: `11`  
*Explanation: Activate index 1 first (limit 2, value 6, active count = 1). Next, activate index 0 (limit 3, value 5, active count = 2). Index 2 (limit 1) can't be activated after any, since after first activation, active count is already too high. Total = 6 + 5 = 11.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `value = [7,1,9,5]`, `limit = [3,4,2,1]`  
Output: `9`  
*Explanation: Only index 2 (limit 2, value 9) can be activated first with 1 active. After, active count is 1, so index 3 (limit 1) cannot be activated. Then all limits ≤ 1 become inactive. Can't activate further. Total = 9.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute force idea:**  
  Try all possible activation orders, simulate permanently inactive process after each, and keep running maximum sum. This is factorial time, infeasible for n > 10.
- **Greedy insight:**  
  Notice that elements with a low limit are risky: as soon as the number of actives grows, they're lost forever. Ideally, activate the best possible high-value candidates before they become unavailable due to active count.
- **Approach:**  
  Sort (limit, value) pairs by increasing limit and, among ties, decreasing value.  
  For each possible active count, greedily select the elements that can be activated.  
  After every activation, mark elements whose limit is now ≤ active count as permanently inactive.  
  Use a set to track which elements are active and which have been permanently disabled.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All limits are 1: Can only activate at most one element.
- Values array with all elements equal.
- Elements already ineligible to start with (limit=0).
- Tied limits but different values.
- n=1.
- All elements have very large limits (all activatable).

### Solution

```python
def maxTotal(value, limit):
    # Pair (limit, value) and sort by (limit, -value) for greedy selection
    A = sorted(zip(limit, value), key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    n = len(A)
    res = 0
    active = set()
    perm_inactive = set()
    from collections import defaultdict
    lim_to_idx = defaultdict(list)

    # Build mapping: limit l → list of indices in sorted array
    for idx, (lim, _) in enumerate(A):
        lim_to_idx[lim].append(idx)

    for idx, (lim, val) in enumerate(A):
        if len(active) >= lim:
            # Can't activate if active count is not strictly less than limit
            continue
        if idx in perm_inactive:
            # Skip if permanently inactive
            continue
        res += val
        active.add(idx)
        x = len(active)
        # After activation, all with limit ≤ active count now become permanently disabled
        for j in lim_to_idx[x]:
            active.discard(j)
            perm_inactive.add(j)
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) for the sorting step. The rest of the operations are linear in n (each element processed once).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the sorted array, mappings, active and perm_inactive sets.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Can you achieve this without explicitly marking permanently inactive elements?  
  *Hint: Maybe process in a single loop with careful pointer or queue management.*

- What changes if the limit condition is "less than or **equal** to" instead of "strictly less than"?  
  *Hint: Adjust the activation rule to check for ≤.*

- How would you solve this if value or limit arrays are very large (e.g., 10⁶ elements)?  
  *Hint: Try an in-place sort, or process the arrays using a priority queue to handle most promising candidates.*

### Summary
This problem demonstrates a classic **greedy** and **sorting by constraint** pattern:  
When constraints (like limits) risk making good options unavailable, prioritize them carefully—sort by the constraint, then quality/value. This is a common approach in activation or scheduling problems, especially where **greedy selection** with side effects (e.g., in eligibility/pruning) is required.  
Patterns like this are useful in interval scheduling, jobs-with-deadlines, and greedy heap questions.
