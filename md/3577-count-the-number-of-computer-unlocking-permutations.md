### Leetcode 3577 (Medium): Count the Number of Computer Unlocking Permutations [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-computer-unlocking-permutations)

### Description  
Given an array `complexity` of length n, where each computer i is secured by a lock of complexity `complexity[i]`, and computer 0 is already unlocked, we can unlock a computer i only if we have already unlocked some computer j such that `complexity[j] < complexity[i]`. Our task: **Count the number of permutations of [0, 1, ..., n-1] representing a valid order to unlock all computers, starting from 0**, following the above unlock dependency rule.  
Return the count modulo 10⁹+7.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `complexity = [1, 3, 2]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Valid orderings are `[0,1,2]` and `[0,2,1]`. Both follow the rule: After unlocking 0 (complexity 1), you can unlock 1 (complexity 3) or 2 (complexity 2) in any order, as both complexities are greater than 1.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `complexity = [2, 1, 3]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: Computer 1 (complexity 1) cannot be unlocked after 0 (complexity 2), since 1 is not greater than 2. No valid permutation exists.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `complexity = [1, 2, 3, 4]`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation: After unlocking 0 (complexity 1), all subsequent computers have increasing complexity, so any order of [1,2,3] is valid — 3! = 6.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force approach:**  
  - Generate all n! permutations of 0..n-1, and check each if it satisfies the unlock conditions. This is clearly infeasible for large n due to factorial growth.
- **Observations for optimization:**  
  - Computer 0 (the only unlocked one initially) must appear first in any valid permutation.
  - For any other computer i, at the time you want to unlock it, you need to have unlocked at least one j with `complexity[j] < complexity[i]`. But since 0 is always first and if all other complexities are greater than `complexity`, any unlock order of the rest is valid.
  - If there exists any `complexity[i] ≤ complexity` (i ≠ 0), *it can never be unlocked* since you require a lower complexity which does not exist among unlocked ones. So, in this case, answer is 0.
  - If all `complexity[1:] > complexity`, there are (n-1)! valid unlock orders of the remaining computers.
- **Final approach:**  
  - Check if all `complexity[1:] > complexity`.  
  - If false, return 0. If true, answer is (n-1)! modulo 10⁹+7.
- **Trade-offs:**  
  - This solution is O(n) time for checking and O(n) for computing factorial, much more efficient than O(n!).

### Corner cases to consider  
- n = 1: Only computer 0 exists, so answer is 1 (0! = 1).
- Any duplicate minimum (`complexity[i] == complexity` for i ≠ 0): impossible, must return 0.
- All remaining computers have strictly increasing complexities: answer is (n-1)!
- Extremely large n: Compute factorial modulo 10⁹+7 efficiently.

### Solution

```python
def countPermutations(complexity):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(complexity)
    
    # Check the unlock pre-condition for each computer after 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if complexity[i] <= complexity[0]:
            return 0
    
    # If valid, count (n-1)! arrangements of the remaining computers
    res = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        res = (res * i) % MOD
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  - O(n) to check the unlock condition.  
  - O(n) to compute factorial of (n-1) modulo 10⁹+7.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  - Only variables for iteration and the output, no extra storage dependent on input size.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if some computers have the same complexity?  
  *Hint: Can a computer with equal complexity ever be unlocked given the rules?*

- What if the initial unlocked computer isn't always at index 0?  
  *Hint: How would you generalize your logic if the start is arbitrary?*

- Can you design this for dynamic unlock conditions or changing complexities?  
  *Hint: How would the dependency structure need to change?*

### Summary
This problem reduces to a verification of a global dependency: every other computer must have strictly higher complexity than the initially unlocked one (index 0), or it will be stuck. If so, the number of ways to unlock is simply the number of permutations of the remaining computers, i.e., (n-1)!. This is a typical constraint-checking followed by a combinatorics (permutation) calculation, a common pattern useful for many dependency-ordering and permutation-counting interview problems.
