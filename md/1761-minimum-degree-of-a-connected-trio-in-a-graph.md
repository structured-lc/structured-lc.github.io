### Leetcode 1761 (Hard): Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-degree-of-a-connected-trio-in-a-graph)

### Description  
Given an undirected graph with `n` nodes (numbered 1 to n) and edges (each as a pair [u, v]), a **connected trio** is a set of three nodes that are all pairwise connected (i.e., they form a triangle or clique of size 3).  
The **degree** of a connected trio is the number of edges that have exactly one endpoint in the trio (i.e., edges that leave the trio).  
Return the **minimum degree** among all connected trios in the graph. If there are no connected trios, return -1.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,2],[4,1],[5,2],[3,6]]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: The only trio is nodes 1, 2, and 3. Their edges to 4, 5, and 6 (from 1 to 4, from 2 to 5, and from 3 to 6) make up the degree, which is 3.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 7, edges = [[1,3],[4,1],[4,3],[2,5],[5,7],[7,2],[6,2],[6,5],[6,7]]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: The trio [2,5,7] is fully connected and has no extra edge to nodes outside the trio. So the degree is 0.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[3,4]]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: The only trio is [1,2,3]. Node 3 connects to 4 (external), so degree is 1 (from 3 to 4). Node 1 and 2 do not have other neighbors. They only connect within the trio, so total degree is 1 (from 3 to 4). However, each external edge is only counted once, so the total degree is 1. But from code and example, expected is 2 (edges: [3,4] and [3,4]—even if counted once), but should be 1. — possible typo in the description or the test expected output, but let's code as per definition given (see explanation below).*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- First, I need to **identify all possible trios** — sets of three nodes (i, j, k) such that each pair has an edge (i.e., the three nodes form a triangle).
- **Brute-force:** For every triple (i < j < k), check if all three edges exist. This is O(n³), which is likely too slow for large n.
- **Optimization:**  
  - Precompute neighbors for each node (adjacency matrix/list).  
  - Loop over all edges (i, j), and for each common neighbor k (neighbors of both i and j), check if (i, j, k) forms a trio.
  - **Faster way:** For each triple (i, j, k), instead of naïvely checking, use adjacency matrix lookup: O(n²) for each node pair, and check for a third node.
- For each trio, calculate the **degree**:
  - Degree of each node = total number of its connections.
  - For a trio: total degree = degree[i] + degree[j] + degree[k] - 6 (subtract the 6 internal edges counted twice for each node in the trio).
  - Why subtract 6? Each internal edge is counted 2 times (each endpoint).
  - This gives the edges going out of the trio.

### Corner cases to consider  
- No trios at all (no triangles in the graph)  
- Multiple trios, but some may have zero external edges  
- Disconnected graph  
- Duplicate or self-loop edges (should not be present, but possible input validation)  
- Sparse graph (few edges)  
- Highly connected graph (complete graphs)

### Solution

```python
def min_trio_degree(n, edges):
    # adjacency: adjacency matrix for fast lookup, 1-based indexing
    adj = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    # degree: degree for each node (1-based)
    degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u][v] = True
        adj[v][u] = True
        degree[u] += 1
        degree[v] += 1

    min_degree = float('inf')

    # For each combination of i < j < k
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if not adj[i][j]:
                continue
            for k in range(j + 1, n + 1):
                if adj[i][k] and adj[j][k]:
                    # Trio found: (i, j, k)
                    # Calculate its external degree
                    # sum of degrees of i, j, k - 6 (each internal edge counted twice: 3 edges)
                    curr_deg = degree[i] + degree[j] + degree[k] - 6
                    if curr_deg < min_degree:
                        min_degree = curr_deg

    return -1 if min_degree == float('inf') else min_degree
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n³) in the worst case (nested loops for i, j, k). Can be a bit faster if the graph is sparse, as many checks exit early if edges don't exist.  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n²) for adjacency matrix; O(n) for degrees.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the input graph can be huge (n > 10⁴)?  
  *Hint: Can we avoid checking all possible trios? Can we use different data structures or matrix sparsity?*

- How would your approach change if you needed to list all minimal trios, not just their minimum degree?  
  *Hint: Can you store the trios while searching, or is there a more memory-efficient way?*

- How would you handle a directed graph?  
  *Hint: Would the concept of trio remain the same, or would you need to redefine it for directionality?*

### Summary
This problem is a classic example of triangle detection and degree computation in an undirected graph, utilizing adjacency matrices for fast lookup and careful degree accounting.  
The pattern of "traversing all possible triplets and counting properties with adjacency checks" applies to social network analysis, triangle counting, and subgraph enumeration in graph theory.  
It's also a good illustration of the interplay between brute-force and targeted enumeration when working with small subgraphs in large graphs.
