### Leetcode 3378 (Hard): Count Connected Components in LCM Graph [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-connected-components-in-lcm-graph)

### Description  
Given an array **nums** of size *n* (all elements unique) and a positive integer **threshold**, construct a graph with *n* nodes where node i has value nums[i]. Two nodes i and j are connected by an edge **if and only if** LCM(nums[i], nums[j]) ≤ threshold.
Your task: **Return the number of connected components** in this graph.

A connected component is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected by a path and which is not connected to any additional vertex in the supergraph.

#### Restating for interview:
Given each node as the unique elements of nums, and edges only between pairs whose LCM is ≤ threshold, count how many isolated groups (connected components) form.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [2,4,8,3,9]`, `threshold = 5`  
Output: `4`  
Explanation:  
Only (2, 4) are connected (since LCM(2,4)=4 ≤ 5). 8, 3, and 9 have no valid edges. So connected components are: (2,4), (8), (3), (9).

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [2,4,8,3,9,12]`, `threshold = 10`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation:  
Nodes (2,3,4,8,9) can be chained by LCM ≤ 10, e.g. (2,4), (4,8), etc. 12 cannot connect to any (LCM with any other > 10). So two components: (2,3,4,8,9), (12).

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [1,7,13,19]`, `threshold = 25`  
Output: `4`  
Explanation:  
LCM of any pair > 25, so all nodes are isolated ➔ 4 components.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute force idea**: For each unordered pair (i, j), compute LCM(nums[i], nums[j]), link them if ≤ threshold. Build the graph, then use DFS/BFS/Union-Find (DSU) to count components.
  - Complexity: O(n²) to check all pairs. For n up to 10⁵, this is infeasible.
- **Optimizing**:
  - Key observation: For two numbers a, b, if their LCM is ≤ threshold, then **both must be ≤ threshold** and must share small divisors.
  - For each num in nums: Only consider multiples of the value up to threshold.
  - Use Union-Find (DSU), but **link a to every other in nums that shares a small enough LCM**.
  - Efficient approach: For each divisor d from threshold+1 up to max(nums), group together all multiples of d that exist in nums (these must have LCM(d, ?) = x × y ≤ threshold). This way, you only link via values that can possibly form an edge.
- **Why this works**: Instead of linking arbitrary pairs, only link multiples for divisors above threshold, which reduces links to ≤ O(n log n).
- **Trade-offs**: This approach leverages number theory (LCM, divisors) to avoid O(n²) pairings. DSU makes the grouping efficient.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty nums array
- Only one element
- All nums[i] > threshold (no edges)
- threshold very large (all possibly connected)
- threshold very small (no connections)
- nums with values just above threshold
- nums with prime numbers only

### Solution

```python
def countComponents(nums, threshold):
    # Map each value to its index for DSU purposes.
    num_index = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(nums)}
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Union-Find data structures
    parent = list(range(n))
    
    def find(u):
        while parent[u] != u:
            parent[u] = parent[parent[u]]
            u = parent[u]
        return u

    def union(u, v):
        pu, pv = find(u), find(v)
        if pu != pv:
            parent[pu] = pv

    max_num = max(nums)
    # For divisors d in (threshold, max_num]:
    # If d appears in nums, group all its multiples from nums
    # For d in range(threshold+1, max_num+1):
    #   connect all nums which are multiples of d
    value_in_nums = set(nums)
    for d in range(threshold+1, max_num+1):
        root = -1
        # for each multiple of d, if it's in nums, union them
        for mult in range(2*d, max_num+1, d):
            if mult in value_in_nums and d in value_in_nums:
                u, v = num_index[mult], num_index[d]
                union(u, v)
        # If only one appears, nothing to union

    # Each component corresponds to a unique root
    components = set(find(i) for i in range(n))
    return len(components)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  - Let n = len(nums), M = max(nums).
  - The outer loop iterates O(M) times (for each d from threshold+1 to max_num).
  - Inner loop touches each multiple: for each number, the number of divisors is ≈ log(max_num). So in practice, O(n log M), since only numbers in nums are checked for each d.
  - DSU operations are nearly constant time (amortized).
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - O(n) for DSU arrays.
  - O(n) for num_index and set of nums.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if nums could have duplicate values?  
  *Hint: Would DSU indexing need to change? What changes in edge-decision logic?*

- How would your solution change if LCM must be strictly less than (not ≤) the threshold?  
  *Hint: Adjust the divisor scan range; when is an edge allowed?*

- Can you return the explicit nodes of each connected component?  
  *Hint: Need to group nums by their DSU root and return those groups.*

### Summary
This problem uses the **Union-Find (DSU)** pattern, efficiently grouping numbers by shared divisors above the threshold, without O(n²) LCM checks. The math/graph hybrid makes this a classic interview example of optimizing graph construction using number theory, and the approach is applicable to other grouping/partitioning problems governed by divisor relationships (e.g., *connected components by GCD*, *clustering by mutual constraints*).
