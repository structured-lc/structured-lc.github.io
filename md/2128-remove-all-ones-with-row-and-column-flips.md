### Leetcode 2128 (Medium): Remove All Ones With Row and Column Flips [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-ones-with-row-and-column-flips)

### Description  
You're given a binary matrix (each cell is 0 or 1). In one operation, you can flip every cell in an entire row or an entire column (change 0→1, 1→0).  
You can perform any number of flips, in any order.  
Return **true** if it is possible to remove all 1s from the matrix (make every cell 0), otherwise return **false**.  
The grid has 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 300.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `[[0,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,0]]`  
Output: `true`  
*Explanation:  
- Flip the middle row:  
  [[0,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,1,0]]  
  → [[0,1,0], [0,1,0], [0,1,0]]  
- Flip the middle column:  
  [[0,1,0], [0,1,0], [0,1,0]]  
  → [[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `[[1,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`  
Output: `false`  
*Explanation:  
It's impossible to flip rows and columns so all 1s become 0s.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `[]`  
Output: `true`  
*Explanation:  
There are no 1s, matrix already all zeros.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, try brute force: try all sequences of row and column flips, but exponential possibilities—impractical for large m, n.

Key insight:  
- Each flip affects an entire row or column, and flipping twice is same as not flipping.
- If you can make all 1s 0 by any sequence, you could always do it by possibly flipping certain rows, then certain columns.
- For any row, its pattern (after possible flips) must match the first row, or its complement (all bits flipped).
- For example, suppose you flip some rows to match the first, then for each column, flip it if the first row in that column is 1.
- Thus, if for every row, the difference with the first row is **the same for all columns in that row**, then it's possible; otherwise not.

So, iterate each row and:
- If each cell in the row is either equal to the corresponding cell in row 0, or exactly not equal (bit-flipped), and this relation is consistent across the row, it's possible.

This is efficient (O(mn)).

### Corner cases to consider  
- 1×1 grid (either  or [1])
- All zeros grid
- All ones grid (if m,n odd or even)
- Grid with only one row or one column
- Rows that match or are complement of the first row
- Rows that are neither equal nor complement

### Solution

```python
def removeOnes(grid):
    # Compute the complement (bit flip) of the first row
    rev = [1 - x for x in grid[0]]

    for row in grid:
        # Row must be equal to first row or its complement
        if not (row == grid[0] or row == rev):
            return False
    return True
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(m × n), since we must check each of the m rows of length n, doing an O(n) equality check for each.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the complement of the first row.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you could also flip submatrices (not just full rows/columns)?
  *Hint: Think about parity and more general group operations.*

- Can you return the minimum number of flips needed, if possible?
  *Hint: Try greedy or BFS to minimize number of flips.*

- What if cells had values from 0 to k instead of binary? (Generalization)
  *Hint: Can you represent the operations in terms of modular additions?*

### Summary
This problem is a matrix bit manipulation problem with "row/column flip" as the allowed operation. The optimal approach: check if each row equals the first row or its complement, which is a common equivalence/consistency-check pattern. This logic can be applied in similar problems involving grid manipulation, toggling states, and subspace or group operations.
