### Leetcode 2546 (Medium): Apply Bitwise Operations to Make Strings Equal [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-bitwise-operations-to-make-strings-equal)

### Description  
You are given two binary strings **s** and **target** of equal length n. On **s**, you can repeatedly choose two distinct indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) and perform:
- s[i] = s[i] OR s[j]
- s[j] = s[i] XOR s[j]

The goal is to use any number of such operations to make **s** equal to **target**. Return whether this is possible.  
Note: OR returns 1 if at least one bit is 1; XOR returns 1 if the bits are different.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "1010"`, `target = "0010"`  
Output: `true`  
*Explanation: Both have at least one '1'. By operations, we can make s match target.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "11"`, `target = "10"`  
Output: `true`  
*Explanation: Both contain '1'. We can switch a 1 to a 0 using the allowed operations.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = "00"`, `target = "10"`  
Output: `false`  
*Explanation: s contains only '0', but target has a '1'; we can't introduce '1' by the allowed operations.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, consider brute force: simulate all possible operations—but this is infeasible for n up to 10⁵ due to combinatorial explosion.

Let's analyze the operation:
- If either s[i] or s[j] is '1', you can propagate '1' throughout any position.
- If all bits in s are '0', you can never make any position in s become '1'.
- Conversely, if target has at least one '1', and s has none, it's impossible.
- The operation only allows basic movement and propagation of 1’s; introducing a 1 where none exists is not possible.

Therefore, **if "1" exists in s** and in target, we can match them.  
If "1" exists in one but not the other, we cannot reach target.

So, the whole solution reduces to checking if both strings have at least one '1' or both have no '1'.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Both s and target contain all '0' (trivially true).
- s contains only '0', target has '1' (impossible).
- Target contains only '0', s has only '1' (possible, as we can flip 1 to 0).
- Strings of length 1.
- Strings with only one bit different.

### Solution

```python
def makeStringsEqual(s: str, target: str) -> bool:
    # The problem reduces to whether both strings contain at least one '1'
    # or both contain no '1'
    return ('1' in s) == ('1' in target)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), as we may need to scan both strings fully to check for '1'.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), only constant space used regardless of input size.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the operation could create a '1' from two '0's?
  *Hint: Think about the closure of the allowed operations.*

- If s and target were not the same length, could you devise a variant solution?
  *Hint: What alignment constraints would appear?*

- Can you generalize this logic for ternary strings or n-ary (0,1,2...), and what would change?
  *Hint: Consider which transformations become possible with more symbols.*

### Summary
This problem showcases a **bit-parity/symmetry** observation: the core of the problem is about the spread (or lack) of 1-bits and not about their initial exact arrangement. Such "can you reach by a group move?" problems often boil down to structural properties rather than simulation.  
Pattern: reducing state space by key bit signatures (existence or absence of a type of bit), often useful in transformation problems where operations don't increase the bit complexity of the data.
