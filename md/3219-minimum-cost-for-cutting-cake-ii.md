### Leetcode 3219 (Hard): Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-cutting-cake-ii)

### Description  
You are given a rectangular cake of size **m × n**. You need to cut the cake into **1 × 1** pieces.  
There are two arrays:  
- **horizontalCut** of length m-1, where horizontalCut[i] is the cost to cut along the horizontal line i (separating rows i and i+1),  
- **verticalCut** of length n-1, where verticalCut[j] is the cost to cut along the vertical line j (separating columns j and j+1).  

At each step, you may cut any **not yet 1 × 1** piece along a remaining horizontal or vertical cut.  
Each cut splits a piece into two smaller pieces.  
The *cost* of a cut is always the same as its assigned value in its array—not multiplied by any factor.

Return the **minimum total cost** to cut the whole cake into **1 × 1** pieces.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `m=3`, `n=3`, `horizontalCut=[2,1]`, `verticalCut=[3,1]`  
Output: `11`  
*Explanation:  
- First, cut vertically at cost 3 (it affects 1 horizontal segment).  
- Then cut horizontally at cost 2 (it affects 2 vertical segments, since the piece is now in two columns).  
- Next, cut horizontally at cost 1 (affects both columns, cost = 2).  
- Then cut vertically at cost 1 (now 3 horizontal pieces being separated, cost = 3).  
- Total: 3 + 2×2 + 2 + 3 = 11.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `m=2`, `n=2`, `horizontalCut=[1]`, `verticalCut=[1]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:  
- Either order: cut horizontally (cost 1, affects 1 column since no vertical cuts), then vertically (cost 1 × 2 rows = 2).  
- Total cost = 1 + 2 = 3.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `m=4`, `n=3`, `horizontalCut=[2,1,3]`, `verticalCut=[3,2]`  
Output: `19`  
*Explanation:  
- Choose cuts in order to minimize multiplicative effect.
- Prioritize expensive cuts when fewer pieces are present to minimize total cost.
- The optimal sequence involves greedy selection based on cost.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
The obvious brute-force solution is to try every possible order of cuts and calculate total costs.  
But since the cost incurred per cut depends on the number of segments in the other direction (since the cut applies to every segment), this is computationally infeasible—too many combinations.  

Key insight:  
- Every time you make a cut, its cost is multiplied by the number of current segments in the *other* direction.
- To minimize total cost, we want high-cost cuts to happen when the multiplier is smallest.  
- That is, **greedily pick the largest available cut at each step** (either horizontal or vertical).  
- This is like the "Minimum Cost to Cut a Board Into Squares" pattern.

Algorithm:  
- Sort horizontalCut and verticalCut in descending order.
- Use two pointers: one for horizontal cuts, one for vertical cuts.
- Start with row_segments=1, col_segments=1.
- At each step, pick the cut (from horizontalCut or verticalCut) with the largest remaining cost.
    - If horizontalCut, cost = horizontalCut[i] × col_segments, increment row_segments.
    - If verticalCut, cost = verticalCut[j] × row_segments, increment col_segments.
- Continue until all cuts are processed.

Trade-offs:  
- This approach guarantees the minimum total cost by keeping large costs from being multiplied by large counts.
- Time complexity is dominated by sorting.

### Corner cases to consider  
- m or n is 1 (no cuts needed, output = 0)
- All cut costs are equal
- Only one direction has cuts
- Large values in one direction, small in the other
- Very large numbers (check for integer overflow if in other languages)
- Already in order / already sorted cuts

### Solution

```python
def minCost(m, n, horizontalCut, verticalCut):
    # Sort cuts descending for greedy selection
    horizontalCut.sort(reverse=True)
    verticalCut.sort(reverse=True)

    h = v = 0  # pointers for horizontal & vertical cuts
    row_segments = 1
    col_segments = 1
    total_cost = 0

    # Greedily choose the next largest cut
    while h < len(horizontalCut) and v < len(verticalCut):
        if horizontalCut[h] >= verticalCut[v]:
            total_cost += horizontalCut[h] * col_segments
            row_segments += 1
            h += 1
        else:
            total_cost += verticalCut[v] * row_segments
            col_segments += 1
            v += 1

    # Process any leftover horizontal cuts
    while h < len(horizontalCut):
        total_cost += horizontalCut[h] * col_segments
        row_segments += 1
        h += 1

    # Process any leftover vertical cuts
    while v < len(verticalCut):
        total_cost += verticalCut[v] * row_segments
        col_segments += 1
        v += 1

    return total_cost
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O((m + n) log(m + n))  
  - Sorting both arrays dominates, then one pass through all cuts.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m + n)  
  - For storing cut arrays and sorting copies.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you had to return the sequence of cuts made?
  *Hint: Track both the chosen cut and its position at each step.*

- How would you solve it if the cost of a cut depended dynamically on the current segment sizes?
  *Hint: The greedy still applies, but you may need priority queues to always grab the "best" cut at each moment.*

- What if there were constraints on which cut can be made based on previous cuts (e.g., must do all vertical before any horizontal)?
  *Hint: Change the greedy to obey the dependency, possibly DP.*

### Summary
The problem uses a classic **greedy, two-pointer** approach: always take the maximum cut available to minimize cost multiplicative effect (like "minimum cost to cut a board into squares").  
This general pattern appears in **resource-splitting problems** and can also be applied to:  
- Minimum cost to cut stick/wood into specified pieces  
- Greedy scheduling where expensive tasks should happen earliest  
Key lesson: when costs multiply with how many times a resource is split, cut the most expensive lines first.
