### Leetcode 2335 (Easy): Minimum Amount of Time to Fill Cups [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-amount-of-time-to-fill-cups)

### Description  
You have three types of water cups to fill: cold, warm, and hot, represented by an array `amount` with three values `[cold, warm, hot]`. Each value represents how many cups of that type you need to fill. The machine can fill one or two cups per second with these constraints: in one second, it can fill either two cups of *different types* or one cup of any type. The task is to find the *minimum number of seconds* required to fill all cups.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `amount = [1,4,2]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: In the first second fill one cold and one warm, second second one warm and one hot, third second one warm and one warm, fourth second the last warm cup.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `amount = [5,4,4]`  
Output: `7`  
*Explanation: Fill two cups of different types every second whenever possible. For example, seconds 1–5: fill cold & hot, cold & warm alternately; then fill remaining cups one by one.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `amount = [0,0,0]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: No cups to fill, so zero seconds needed.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute force:** Try filling cups step by step, picking two different types each second to fill if available. This may involve simulating each second and decrementing counts accordingly. This is correct but inefficient for large values.

- **Optimization insight:** The machine can fill at most two different types in a second, so max speed is roughly half total cups rounded up.

- Key consideration is that if one type has a very large amount compared to the sum of the others, the minimum time must be at least that large amount, because you cannot fill two cups of the same type simultaneously.

- Hence, the answer is the maximum between the largest amount and the ceiling of half the total cups sum:  

  minimum_time = max(max(amount), (sum(amount) + 1) // 2)

- This formula ensures we account for both constraints—largest single cup type and filling two different cups simultaneously.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All zeros in the array (no cups to fill).  
- One type is much larger than the sum of the other two.  
- Two or all amounts equal.  
- Very large numbers to test performance and correctness of formula.  

### Solution

```python
def fillCups(amount):
    # Sort the amounts to easily identify the largest
    amount.sort()
    
    total = sum(amount)
    max_cups = amount[2]
    
    # Minimum time needed is the maximum of:
    # 1. The largest amount (since we cannot fill two cups of the same type simultaneously)
    # 2. Half of the total cups rounded up (when filling two different types simultaneously most of the time)
    return max(max_cups, (total + 1) // 2)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) because operation involves only fixed size array of 3 elements and basic arithmetic.  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since only a few variables are used without extra data structures.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If the machine could fill two cups of the *same* type simultaneously, how would the minimum time change?  
  *Hint: Consider only total sum of cups irrespective of types.*

- How would the solution change if there were more than three types of cups?  
  *Hint: Consider the logic of pairing the types with the largest counts.*

- What if the dispenser could fill up to k cups per second but only different types?  
  *Hint: Consider a generalization of the formula using k and distributions among types.*

### Summary  
This problem is a good example of recognizing that the answer is determined by constraints on the types of items (cups) and pairing strategy rather than simulating every step. The core pattern involves max constraints and pairing sums, common in problems about simultaneous processing of multiple queues or stacks. The key formula combines the maximum single type load and the half of total load, ensuring both conditions are met.
