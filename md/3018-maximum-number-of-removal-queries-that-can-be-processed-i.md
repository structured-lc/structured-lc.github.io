### Leetcode 3018 (Hard): Maximum Number of Removal Queries That Can Be Processed I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-removal-queries-that-can-be-processed-i)

### Description  
You are given two 0-indexed arrays: **nums** and **queries**. Before processing queries, you may replace *nums* with any of its subsequences (optionally, at most once; if you do, you must do it upfront and not again).  
To process each query in order:  
- If *both* the first and last element of *nums* are less than the current query value, stop processing further queries.  
- Else, you must remove from either the start or end an element ≥ the current query value. If this isn't possible, also stop.
Return the maximum number of queries you can process, if you pick the subsequence optimally at the start.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5], queries = [1,2,3,4,6]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation:  
1. Remove nums=1 (1 ≥ 1), nums=[2,3,4,5]  
2. Remove nums=2 (2 ≥ 2), nums=[3,4,5]  
3. Remove nums=3 (3 ≥ 3), nums=[4,5]  
4. Remove nums=4 (4 ≥ 4), nums=[5]  
5. Now both ends 5 < 6, so we cannot process query 5. So max = 4.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [2,4,2], queries = [2,2,2]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:  
1. Remove nums=2 (2 ≥ 2), nums=[4,2]  
2. Remove nums=4 (4 ≥ 2), nums=[2]  
3. Remove nums=2 (2 ≥ 2), nums=[]  
We process all 3 queries, answer is 3.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [2,1,4,2], queries = [3,4,2]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:  
1. Remove nums[2]=4 (from end, 4 ≥ 3), nums=[2,1,2]  
2. Remove nums=2 or nums[2]=2 but neither ≥ 4, so cannot process query 2. Only 1 processed.  
If instead, first remove nums[2]=4 for query 1, then try for query 2 and so on -- maximum you can ever process here is 2.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute force:** Try every possible subsequence and process as above, but there are 2ⁿ subsequences—too slow.
- **Key Insight:** The subsequence operation is only allowed up front. For each possible subarray (i, j), consider if picking it lets you process more queries.
- For each [l,r] in nums, use DP: f[l][r] = max queries you can process from nums[l:r+1].
- For each query, at each step, choose to remove from the left or right—if possible, and recurse. Memoize so overlapping subproblems are not repeated.
- The answer is the maximum f[l][r] across all l, r.
- This is a classic interval DP: for each subarray try to process as many queries as possible, try either removal, and recurse.

### Corner cases to consider  
- nums or queries empty.
- All nums less than first query.
- All queries trivially satisfied by a single element.
- All nums identical.
- nums already ordered but queries not.
- Subarray selection doesn't help (best to not subsequence).
- nums has a single element.
- Only one query.

### Solution

```python
def maximum_removal_queries(nums, queries):
    n = len(nums)
    m = len(queries)

    # Memoization cache: (l, r, idx of query) → max queries we can process
    from functools import lru_cache

    # For a contiguous subsequence nums[l:r+1], starting from query idx
    def dp(l, r, idx):
        if l > r or idx == m:
            return 0
        # If both ends less than queries[idx], must stop.
        if nums[l] < queries[idx] and nums[r] < queries[idx]:
            return 0
        ans = 0
        # Remove from left if possible
        if nums[l] >= queries[idx]:
            ans = max(ans, 1 + dp(l+1, r, idx+1))
        # Remove from right if possible
        if nums[r] >= queries[idx]:
            ans = max(ans, 1 + dp(l, r-1, idx+1))
        return ans

    res = 0
    # Try every (l, r) as initial subsequence (can skip elements at ends)
    for l in range(n):
        for r in range(l, n):
            res = max(res, dp(l, r, 0))
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n² × m).  
  There are O(n²) possible subarrays and for each, up to m queries. Each dp(l, r, idx) state may be visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n² × m) for the DP/memoization table.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If you were only allowed to remove from one end (always left or always right), how would the solution change?  
  *Hint: Greedy scan, no DP needed.*

- Can you optimize the algorithm for cases where nums, queries are very large?  
  *Hint: Space optimization, observe that only certain subarrays/states matter, pruning.*

- What if you can perform the subsequence operation at any time, not just at the start?  
  *Hint: This greatly increases complexity, possibly requires new state definitions.*

### Summary
This problem illustrates the interval DP pattern, where the optimal solution for a range depends on choices at the ends. The single allowed subsequence operation means we must try every possible starting subarray, turning the task into maximizing the removal process for each possible interval. This DP/trial-all-intervals pattern is common in problems with removal from ends, like "Palindrome Removal" and "Burst Balloons."
