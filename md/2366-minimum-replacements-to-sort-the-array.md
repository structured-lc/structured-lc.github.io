### Leetcode 2366 (Hard): Minimum Replacements to Sort the Array [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-replacements-to-sort-the-array)

### Description  
Given a 0-indexed integer array **nums**, you can repeatedly pick any element and replace it with *any two* positive integers that **sum to it**. Each such replacement counts as one operation.  
Your goal: Find the minimum number of such operations needed to transform **nums** into a sorted (non-decreasing) array.

*In other words*: For every 0 ≤ i < j < n, you want nums[i] ≤ nums[j], and at each step you can replace a number with two smaller positive numbers that add up to it.  

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `[3,9,3]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:*  
- Replace 9 with 3 and 6: array becomes `[3,3,6,3]`  
- Replace 6 with 3 and 3: array becomes `[3,3,3,3,3]`  
Now the array is non-decreasing.  

**Example 2:**  
Input: `[1,2,3,4,5]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation:*  
The array is already in non-decreasing order.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `[5,4,3,2,1]`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation:*  
One possible sequence:  
- Replace 5 with 3 and 2: `[3,2,4,3,2,1]`  
- Replace 4 with 2 and 2: `[3,2,2,2,3,2,1]`  
- Replace 3 with 2 and 1: `[2,2,2,2,2,3,2,1]`  
- Replace 3 with 2 and 1: `[2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1]`  
- Continue replacing 2s as needed...  
It takes 6 steps (can be achieved with different choices).

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force:**  
  Consider splitting every number that's larger than the next into 2 numbers, repeating until the array is non-decreasing. But this could create exponentially many elements and is inefficient.

- **Optimize – Work Backwards, Greedy:**  
  Start from the end. For each position i (from n-2 to 0), ensure nums[i] ≤ nums[i+1]:
  - If nums[i] ≤ nums[i+1], no replacement needed.  
  - If nums[i] > nums[i+1], split nums[i] into k parts so no part is larger than nums[i+1].
  - Let parts = ⌈nums[i] / nums[i+1]⌉, so each part ≤ nums[i+1].
  - This costs (parts - 1) operations. Set nums[i] = nums[i] // parts for the next steps, then continue.
  - Greedy works because to minimize operations, always make splits as large as possible (i.e., keep resulting numbers as big as possible without violating sorting constraint).

- **Why Greedy/Right-to-Left?**  
  Adjustments work only if the "tail" is correct first. Only the next-larger neighbor restricts splitting. If you work right-to-left, you always know the needed bound for splits.

- **Trade-off:**  
  O(n) solution, only modifies inputs in-place, no extra storage needed.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Single-element array (no operations needed)
- Already sorted array
- All elements equal
- Decreasing array (worst case)
- Large elements next to small ones
- Large input size (efficiency!)
- nums[i] == 1 (cannot split further; will never need splitting)

### Solution

```python
def minimumReplacement(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    ans = 0
    max_right = nums[-1]   # Start from the rightmost value
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if nums[i] <= max_right:
            max_right = nums[i]
            continue
        # Calculate how many parts needed so that every part ≤ max_right
        parts = (nums[i] + max_right - 1) // max_right  # ceil division
        ans += parts - 1  # Each split: one operation
        max_right = nums[i] // parts  # Update bound for the next step
    return ans
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(n), where n is the length of the input, since we only do a single pass from right to left.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(1) extra space, as all bookkeeping uses a few variables and we can modify in-place.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If you needed to also **output the actual sequence** after all operations, how would you do it?  
  *Hint: Track splits and new elements as you process, possibly reconstructing the array.*

- If instead you wanted the array to be **strictly increasing**, how would the approach change?  
  *Hint: Instead of ≤, use <, adjust how you choose parts when equal.*

- Can you **optimize further** for the case when the array elements are all small integers?  
  *Hint: Consider the properties of the possible splits and whether a table/caching speeds it up for small values.*

### Summary
This problem uses a **greedy right-to-left scan with math for optimal splitting**, a classic pattern for "make array satisfy a property with minimum local changes" type problems. Similar greedy approaches apply to "min operations to strictly increase/decrease, split/merge arrays for constraints, etc." and other array transformation questions where moves are localized and options must be minimized.
