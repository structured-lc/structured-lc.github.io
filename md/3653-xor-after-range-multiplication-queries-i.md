### Leetcode 3653 (Medium): XOR After Range Multiplication Queries I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/xor-after-range-multiplication-queries-i)

### Description  
You are given an integer array **nums** and a list of queries where each query is of the form `[l, r, x, m]`. For each query, multiply every element in the subarray from index **l** to **r** (inclusive) where the index `i` satisfies that `i % x == 0`, by **m**. After all queries are finished, return the bitwise XOR of all elements in the final **nums** array.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1, 1, 1]`, `queries = [[0, 2, 1, 4]]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: The only query multiplies every element in indices 0, 1, 2 (since 0 % 1 == 0, 1 % 1 == 0, 2 % 1 == 0) by 4, so array becomes [4,4,4]. Final xor = 4 ⊕ 4 ⊕ 4 = 4.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [2, 3, 4, 5]`, `queries = [[1, 3, 2, 10]]`  
Output: `14`  
*Explanation: Only indices between 1 and 3 inclusive are checked. Consider i:  
   - i=1 → 1 % 2 ≠ 0 (skip)  
   - i=2 → 2 % 2 == 0 (multiply nums[2] \*10 → 40)  
   - i=3 → 3 % 2 ≠ 0 (skip)  
   Final nums: [2, 3, 40, 5]; XOR: 2 ⊕ 3 ⊕ 40 ⊕ 5 = 14.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums=[1,3,5,7]`, `queries=[[1,2,1,2],[0,3,2,10]]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation:  
- 1st query: multiply all elements indices 1 and 2 (since x=1) by 2 → [1,6,10,7]  
- 2nd query: for i=0,2 (0 % 2 == 0, 2 % 2 == 0), multiply nums \*10, nums[2] \*10 → [10,6,100,7]  
Final: [10,6,100,7]; XOR: 10 ⊕ 6 ⊕ 100 ⊕ 7 = 0*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute-force approach**:  
  For every query, we iterate from l to r and for every index in that range, check if i % x == 0, and multiply nums[i] by m. This is O(q × n), where q is number of queries and n is the array length. After all, calculate XOR of the whole array.

- **Optimizations?**  
  - If queries are large and there are many of them, O(q×n) might be slow. For this problem, since the constraints for I are low (as given by being "I"), brute force is acceptable.
  - If needed, for large ranges, could optimize with a bitmask, difference array, or advanced lazy updates, but those are constrained in variant II.
  - Final XOR calculation is simple as single pass.

### Corner cases to consider  
- No queries (`queries = []`) — XOR of original nums.
- Query with l > r or nonsensical (shouldn't happen by constraints).
- Edge queries (l=0, r=n-1, x=1).
- x > r — may skip all elements.
- One-element arrays.
- Multiplying by 0 (all elements become 0).
- Large or negative multipliers.

### Solution

```python
def xorAfterQueries(nums, queries):
    # For each query, apply the respective multiplication
    for l, r, x, m in queries:
        for i in range(l, r+1):
            if i % x == 0:
                nums[i] *= m
    # Compute XOR of the updated array
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(q × n) in the worst case: for each query (q), may have to process up to n elements. Acceptance for "I" variant.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space (in-place updates and one int for XOR), aside from input storage.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle very large arrays or many queries efficiently?  
  *Hint: Consider difference arrays or segment tree range updates.*

- How can you optimize if queries are mostly on the same ranges?  
  *Hint: Batch or pre-compute ranges; lazy propagation.*

- What changes if you need to support undo/rollback of queries?  
  *Hint: Persistent data structures or redo logs.*

### Summary
The problem uses an in-place brute-force pattern to apply updates, as the constraints (Variant I) allow. The postprocessing XOR pass is also common in problems involving array mutation and aggregate reduction (like "range update + query"). This approach is classic for "brute-force allowed" range update and is frequently used for easy/medium range query problems. The pattern can be extended with advanced data structures for harder variants.
