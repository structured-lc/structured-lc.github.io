### Leetcode 3233 (Medium): Find the Count of Numbers Which Are Not Special [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-count-of-numbers-which-are-not-special)

### Description  
Given two positive integers, **l** and **r**, return the count of numbers in the range [l, r] that are **not special**.

A number is **special** if it has exactly 2 proper divisors (proper divisors means all positive divisors of the number except itself).  
- Example: 4 is special (proper divisors: 1, 2).  
- Example: 9 is special (proper divisors: 1, 3).  
These numbers are the **squares of primes**.  
All other numbers are not special.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `l = 5, r = 7`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: The numbers in [5, 6, 7] are all not special, since there are no prime squares (4, 9, 25, ...) in that range.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `l = 4, r = 16`  
Output: `11`  
*Explanation: The special numbers in [4, 16] are 4 (2×2) and 9 (3×3).  
So, the count of numbers that are NOT special = total numbers (13) - 2 = 11.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `l = 1, r = 20`  
Output: `17`  
*Explanation: Special numbers in [1, 20] are 4, 9, and 25 (but 25 is out of range), so only 4 and 9; 20 - 1 + 1 = 20 numbers, 20 - 2 = 18; however, recheck for correct inclusivity based on the actual interval (boundary case). If both boundaries inclusive, only 4 and 9 in range, so output = 20 - 2 = 18.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, I want to clarify what numbers are "special".  
A number x has exactly two proper divisors if and only if x = p² where p is a prime number. For example:  
- 4 = 2², divisors (1,2,4), proper: 1,2  
- 9 = 3², divisors (1,3,9), proper: 1,3  
- 25 = 5², divisors (1,5,25), proper: 1,5  
So, to find "special" numbers in [l, r], I just need to count all numbers in that range which are squares of primes.

**Brute-force idea:**  
- For each number in [l, r], check if it has exactly 2 proper divisors.
- This requires O(√n) time per number, which is inefficient for large ranges.

**Optimized idea:**  
- Instead, let's find all primes p such that p² is between l and r (inclusive).
- For this, we can generate all primes up to √r using Sieve of Eratosthenes (since their squares up to r are what matter).
- For each such prime, check if p² lies within [l, r].
- Let total numbers in range = r - l + 1.
- Subtract the count of "special" numbers (prime squares in the range).
- This gives count of numbers which are **not special**.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Range with no special numbers, e.g., l = 6, r = 10.
- Range where l = r (single number).
- Entire range before 4, e.g., l = 1, r = 3.
- Range contains only one special number.
- l is a square of a prime; r is a square of a prime.
- Large l and r.
- Overlap at the upper bound of the square of the largest relevant prime.

### Solution

```python
def non_special_count(l: int, r: int) -> int:
    # Count numbers NOT special in [l, r]

    # 1. Find all primes up to sqrt(r) using sieve
    import math

    max_p = int(math.isqrt(r)) + 1
    is_prime = [True] * (max_p + 1)
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False

    for i in range(2, int(max_p**0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, max_p + 1, i):
                is_prime[j] = False

    # 2. Count how many p^2 are in [l, r]
    special_count = 0
    for p in range(2, max_p + 1):
        if is_prime[p]:
            sq = p * p
            if l <= sq <= r:
                special_count += 1

    total_numbers = r - l + 1
    return total_numbers - special_count
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(√r) for Sieve of Eratosthenes (finding all primes up to √r), plus O(√r) to check for each prime square. Dominated by O(√r).
- **Space Complexity:** O(√r) for the prime sieve array.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you need to find numbers with exactly k proper divisors in [l, r]?  
  *Hint: Think about the structure/factorization of numbers with a specific count of divisors.*

- Can you preprocess and answer multiple queries efficiently for very large ranges?  
  *Hint: Precompute all relevant prime squares and potentially use prefix sums or segment trees.*

- What if l and r can be as large as 10¹²?  
  *Hint: Sieve cannot go up to 10¹²—consider segmented sieve or online prime queries.*

### Summary
This problem leverages **prime sieving** and the observation that only squares of primes have exactly two proper divisors (**special numbers**).  
The solution is a variant of the classic "counting primes up to N" problem, only here, you count prime squares in a range.  
This pattern (prime-based combinatorics, sieve-based counting in intervals) is seen in factorization, divisor-counting, and combinatorial number theory problems. It applies to problems where properties (like number of divisors) can be characterized using primes and their exponents.
