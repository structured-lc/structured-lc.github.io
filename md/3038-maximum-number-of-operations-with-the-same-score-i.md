### Leetcode 3038 (Easy): Maximum Number of Operations With the Same Score I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-operations-with-the-same-score-i)

### Description  
You are given an integer array **nums**. Starting from the front, you can remove pairs of adjacent elements (**nums** and **nums[1]**, then the new **nums** and **nums[1]**, etc). Each time you remove a pair, the "score" for that operation is the sum of the removed pair.  
Your task is to compute the **maximum number of pairs you can remove sequentially** such that **all the removed pairs have the same score** (i.e., the sum remains constant for all operations).  
Return the number of such operations that can be performed.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [3,2,1,4,5,6]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Only one operation: Remove 3 and 2 (score = 5). The next pair 1,4 has a sum 5, so we can remove again (that's two operations), but after that, 5,6 = 11 ≠ 5. So, only one full operation.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1,1,1,1]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Remove (1,1) → score = 2, remove next (1,1) → score = 2. Both valid, so 2 operations can be performed.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [2,3,3,2,2,3,2,3]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Remove (2,3)=5, (3,2)=5, (2,3)=5. Last remaining element cannot form a pair, stop at 3 operations.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The main observation is that **each operation must remove the first two elements, and their sums must match the very first pair's sum**.
- Brute-force scanning all pairs is not needed; since pairs are sequential and always from the front, we can process left-to-right in steps of 2.
- Each time, check if the next pair's sum matches the target (the sum of the first two elements). Increment a counter while this holds, stop as soon as it changes or if we run out of pairs.
- This gives an **O(n)** time solution with **O(1)** space.
- Edge cases: If less than two elements remain, operations must stop.  

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty array or only one element: `nums = []` or `nums = [5]` ⇒ 0 operations.
- Odd-length array: The last element will always be leftover and cannot be used.
- All pairs match the sum: Eg. `[2,3,2,3,2,3]`.
- First pair does not match second: should early stop at 1 operation.
- Negative numbers or zeros in the input.

### Solution

```python
def max_operations(nums):
    # Cannot perform any operation if less than 2 elements
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return 0
    
    # The target score: sum of first two elements
    target = nums[0] + nums[1]
    count = 1  # At least one operation is always possible if len >= 2

    # Process pairs from left to right, starting at index 2
    for i in range(2, len(nums)-1, 2):
        current_sum = nums[i] + nums[i+1]
        if current_sum == target:
            count += 1
        else:
            break  # As soon as score is different, we must stop
    return count
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  We scan the array once, checking each pair, making ⌊n/2⌋ iterations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  Only a few variables are used regardless of input size.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you could remove any two adjacent numbers, not just from the front?  
  *Hint: Consider sliding window or DP, but constraint becomes much more complex.*

- How would you return not just the count, but also all pairs that matched the target score?  
  *Hint: Store indices or values along with counting, but still scan in pairs.*

- What if you could choose the target score instead of forcing it to the first pair's sum?  
  *Hint: You’d need to try all possible pairwise sums as the score, probably O(n²) complexity.*

### Summary
This problem is a **greedy array scan** using the "check consecutive pairs" pattern. It's typical for linear problems involving sequential removals from an array, commonly appearing in *greedy* and *sliding window* type questions.  
The main coding pattern is **process in fixed-size chunks, and stop as soon as an element violates the rule**—a common approach for validating uniformity in segments or rolling windows.
