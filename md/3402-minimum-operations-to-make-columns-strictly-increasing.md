### Leetcode 3402 (Easy): Minimum Operations to Make Columns Strictly Increasing [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-columns-strictly-increasing)

### Description  
Given an m × n matrix **grid** of non-negative integers, you can increment any grid[i][j] by 1 in a single operation.  
Return the **minimum number of operations** required so that every **column** becomes **strictly increasing** (i.e., for all 0 ≤ row < m-1, grid[row][col] < grid[row+1][col]).  
You can increase any value as much as needed, but only via increments.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `grid = [[3,2],[1,3],[3,4],[0,1]]`  
Output: `15`  
Explanation:  
- For column 0:  
  - grid=3, grid[1]=1 (needs to be >3 ⇒ increment to 4: 3 operations)  
  - grid[2]=3 (needs to be >4 ⇒ increment to 5: 2 operations)  
  - grid[3]=0 (needs to be >5 ⇒ increment to 6: 6 operations)  
- For column 1:  
  - grid[1]=2, grid[1][1]=3 (already >2)  
  - grid[2][1]=4 (already >3)  
  - grid[3][1]=1 (needs to be >4 ⇒ increment to 5: 4 operations)  
Total operations: 3+2+6+4 = **15**

**Example 2:**  
Input: `grid = [[3,2,1],[2,1,0],[1,2,3]]`  
Output: `12`  
Explanation:  
- For column 0:  
  - grid=3, grid[1]=2 (needs to be >3 ⇒ 2→4: 2 ops), grid[2]=1 (needs to be >4 ⇒ 1→5: 4 ops)  
- For column 1:  
  - grid[1]=2, grid[1][1]=1 (needs to be >2 ⇒ 1→3: 2 ops), grid[2][1]=2 (needs to be >3 ⇒ 2→4: 2 ops)  
- For column 2:  
  - grid[2]=1, grid[1][2]=0 (needs to be >1 ⇒ 0→2: 2 ops)  
Total: 2+4+2+2+2 = **12**

**Example 3:**  
Input: `grid = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]`  
Output: `9`  
Explanation:  
- Each column:  
  - grid[j]=1, grid[1][j] must be >1 ⇒ 2 (1 op), grid[2][j] must be >2 ⇒ 3 (2 ops).  
- For both columns: (1+2) × 2 = **6**

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force idea:**  
  - For each column, simulate every sequence of increments needed for all possible orderings. Not scalable.
- **Greedy approach:**  
  - For each column, make each cell just larger than the previous cell (top to bottom).  
  - Track what value the previous cell in the column should be.  
  - If current ≥ prev + 1, do nothing; if not, increment to prev+1 and count the increments.  
  - Columns are independent, so process each independently.  
- **Complexity:**  
  - One pass per cell. Simple and straightforward, ensures minimal necessary increments.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All elements in a column already strictly increasing: No operations needed.
- All elements equal in a column: Maximum number of operations needed (makes a staircase: e.g., 1,2,3,...).
- Single row: No increments needed (no strictly increasing check).
- Single column: Treated same as above, each cell must be greater than the one above.
- Zeros or minimum values.
- Large values near maximum constraint (should not cause overflow in code).

### Solution

```python
def minNumberOfOperations(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    ops = 0
    for col in range(n):
        prev = grid[0][col]
        for row in range(1, m):
            cur = grid[row][col]
            if cur > prev:
                prev = cur
            else:
                # Need at least prev + 1 to be strictly greater
                needed = prev + 1
                ops += needed - cur
                prev = needed
    return ops
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(m × n) — Each cell is visited once.  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — Only a few variables per loop; nothing proportional to input size is allocated.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you could **decrement** as well as increment?  
  *Hint: Is there a way to adjust both up and down to minimize operations?*
- What if the operation could modify the **entire row or column** in one step?  
  *Hint: Can batch operations reduce total costs? Try to formulate the minimum operations mathematically.*
- How would you handle if some cells could **not** be incremented at all?  
  *Hint: What if there are fixed cells that must remain unchanged? What impact does this have on the feasibility/solution?*

### Summary
A classic **greedy, column-by-column** solution: Only increment when a cell is not strictly greater than the one above. Process each column independently because no increments in one column affect another.  
This is a common pattern in **matrix problems with local constraints** (rows/columns handled independently). This is related to problems with monotonicity constraints, such as making sequences strictly increasing by minimal edits.
