### Leetcode 3262 (Medium): Find Overlapping Shifts [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-overlapping-shifts)

### Description  
Given a table `EmployeeShifts` with columns `employee_id`, `start_time`, and `end_time`, find, for each employee, the number of overlapping shifts they have. Two shifts overlap if one ends after another starts. For each employee, output their `employee_id` with the total count of their overlapping shifts (an overlap counts as one, regardless of how many other shifts it overlaps with), including only those employees with at least one overlap.  
Return the result ordered by `employee_id` ascending.

**In other words:**  
For every pair of shifts for the same employee, if the first shift ends after the second shift starts (and starts before), count that as an overlap. Report, for every employee, the number of such overlaps they have.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
`EmployeeShifts = [ [1, '08:00:00', '12:00:00'], [1, '11:00:00', '15:00:00'], [1, '14:00:00', '18:00:00'] ]`  
Output:  
`[ [1, 2] ]`  
*Explanation: Employee 1 has three shifts:*
- *08:00-12:00*  
- *11:00-15:00*  
- *14:00-18:00*  
*The first overlaps with the second (08-12 ends after 11 starts); the second with the third (11-15 ends after 14 starts). So two overlapping pairs.*

**Example 2:**  
Input:  
`EmployeeShifts = [ [2, '09:00:00', '17:00:00'], [2, '16:00:00', '20:00:00'] ]`  
Output:  
`[ [2, 1] ]`  
*Explanation: Employee 2's shifts overlap: the first ends after the second starts (16:00 < 17:00), so one overlap.*

**Example 3:**  
Input:  
`EmployeeShifts = [ [3, '10:00:00', '12:00:00'], [3, '13:00:00', '15:00:00'], [3, '16:00:00', '18:00:00'] ]`  
Output:  
`[ ]`  
*Explanation: None of employee 3's shifts overlap—they are each separated, so no output for employee 3.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, I want to compare every pair of shifts for each employee to find overlaps. The brute-force method checks all pairs:

- For each employee, compare every shift (i) with every other shift (j), where i < j.
- For a pair to overlap: shift[i].end_time > shift[j].start_time and shift[i].start_time < shift[j].start_time.

This is \(O(n^2)\) per employee, but since shifts per employee are small, it’s often reasonable.

Optimization:  
- Since each employee's shifts can be sorted by start_time, we may be able to improve overlap detection, but with arbitrary intervals and times, it’s not always much faster for counting pairs.
- The core requirement is pairwise comparison for overlap, so self-joining the table (in SQL) or nested loops (in Python) is reasonable and clear.
- Final approach: For every employee, for each shift pair where i < j, if first_shift.end_time > second_shift.start_time, count as an overlap.

### Corner cases to consider  
- No employees: Output is empty.
- Employees with only one shift: No possible overlaps.
- Employees with all shifts back-to-back (end_time == start_time): No overlap.
- Multiple overlapping shifts: Need to count all overlapping pairs.
- Identical shifts (same start and end): Overlap (if i < j).
- Time format edge cases (midnight, 23:59, etc.).

### Solution

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def find_overlapping_shifts(employee_shifts):
    # Parse and group shifts by employee_id
    shifts = defaultdict(list)
    for emp_id, start, end in employee_shifts:
        # Convert time strings to minutes for comparison
        hh1, mm1, ss1 = map(int, start.split(':'))
        hh2, mm2, ss2 = map(int, end.split(':'))
        start_mins = hh1 * 60 + mm1 + ss1 / 60
        end_mins = hh2 * 60 + mm2 + ss2 / 60
        shifts[emp_id].append( (start_mins, end_mins) )

    result = []
    for emp_id in sorted(shifts.keys()):
        emp_shifts = sorted(shifts[emp_id])  # sort by start time
        n = len(emp_shifts)
        count = 0
        # For every distinct pair of shifts, count overlaps
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                s1, e1 = emp_shifts[i]
                s2, e2 = emp_shifts[j]
                # If current shift ends after next shift starts, it's an overlap
                # and only consider forward (i < j, s1 < s2)
                if e1 > s2 and s1 < s2:
                    count += 1
        if count > 0:
            result.append( [emp_id, count] )
    return result
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(m × k²), where m is the number of employees and k is the max number of shifts per employee; for each employee, we check all shift pairs.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m × k), to store all employee shift lists, plus output space.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the time intervals can cross midnight (e.g., 22:00–02:00)?
  *Hint: You need to handle intervals that "wrap" over midnight. Convert times or normalize accordingly.*

- How would you handle very large datasets efficiently?
  *Hint: Consider sorting, sweep line, or interval trees, and avoid O(n²) nested comparisons.*

- Can you also report the exact pairs of overlapping shifts, not just the counts?
  *Hint: Collect and store the overlapping pairs as (start₁,end₁)-(start₂,end₂) rather than just counting them.*

### Summary
This is a classic **interval overlap detection** problem. The pattern is pairwise comparison within grouped data—often solved by self-join in SQL, or nested loops in Python. This is commonly used whenever determining schedule conflicts, room bookings, or event overlaps. More advanced variants use sweep-line algorithms for improved efficiency.
