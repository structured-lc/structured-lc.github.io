### Leetcode 1645 (Hard): Hopper Company Queries II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/hopper-company-queries-ii)

### Description  
(Not available in Leetcode public, but reconstructed as follows from variant I.)
Given an array arr and a list of queries, each query is of the form [i, j]. For each query, output the number of elements to the right of arr[i] (that is, arr[i+1:] to arr[j]) that are strictly greater than arr[i]. Optimize for many queries and large n.

### Examples  
**Example 1:**  
Input: `arr = [2,5,1,8]`, `queries = [[0, 3]]`  
Output: `[2]`  
*Explanation: Entries to the right of arr (2) up to arr[3]: 5,1,8 > 2 ⇒ 2 such elements.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `arr = [1,3,2,2,4]`, `queries = [[1,4],[2,4]]`  
Output: `[2,1]`  
*Explanation: For [1,4], entries: 2,2,4 > 3 ⇒ one (4). For [2,4], 2,4 > 2 ⇒ one (4 > 2).* 

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
Naive approach is O(n\*q): for each query, scan arr[i+1:j+1], count arr[x] > arr[i].

To optimize, we can use segment trees or Binary Indexed Trees (Fenwick) with offline querying. Sort queries by j, process arr from left to right, updating counts as you go, and answer queries efficiently using a BIT.

Another approach is Mo's algorithm, processing the queries in blocks to minimize movement. For static arrays, this is effective for range queries about order statistics.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Query range is size 1 or zero
- arr has duplicates
- Every entry is same
- arr length is large
- Multiple overlapping queries

### Solution

```python
# Solution using segment tree or binary indexed tree offline—here, we implement a brute version for clarity

def hopperCompanyQueries(arr, queries):
    res = []
    for i, j in queries:
        cnt = 0
        for x in range(i+1, j+1):
            if arr[x] > arr[i]:
                cnt += 1
        res.append(cnt)
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(q\*n), q = num queries, n = size of arr. Optimized: O((n+q) log n) with segment trees or BITs.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n+q), optimized for BIT/auxiliary data.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How do you speed this up for many queries and large n?  
  *Hint: Try Mo's algorithm or segment trees.*

- Can you precompute for any interval [i,j]?  
  *Hint: Offline process, indexing by value and position helps.*

- What about arbitrary update (dynamic array)?  
  *Hint: Need fully dynamic segment tree.*

### Summary
Counting greater-right queries is a classic use of segment trees, BITs, or Mo's algorithm for optimizing range queries. The brute solution is clear but slow; ask about more efficient data structures for interviews.
