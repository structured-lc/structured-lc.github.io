### Leetcode 2932 (Easy): Maximum Strong Pair XOR I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-strong-pair-xor-i)

### Description  
Given an array of integers `nums`, find the **maximum XOR** value you can get by choosing any **strong pair** `(x, y)` in `nums`.  
A **strong pair** is a pair of numbers such that `|x - y| ≤ min(x, y)`.  
You may use the same element twice (i.e., `(x, x)` is allowed).

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
Output: `7`  
*Explanation:  
Strong pairs include (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5).  
Maximum XOR is 3 ⊕ 4 = 7.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [3,10,5,25,2,8]`  
Output: `28`  
*Explanation:  
Strong pairs include (5,25), because |5-25|=20 ≤ min(5,25)=5.  
Maximum XOR is 5 ⊕ 25 = 28.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [7,7,7]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation:  
All elements are equal, so all pairs are (7,7).  
7 ⊕ 7 = 0.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
I need to find the maximum XOR across all strong pairs, where a strong pair is defined as |x-y| ≤ min(x, y).  
The brute-force approach is to check all pairs (including duplicates), check if they satisfy the strong pair condition, then calculate the XOR and keep the max found.  
This is O(n²) since we try all pairs.  
To optimize, I considered sorting or using data structures like Trie, but since the strong pair condition depends on both values, every element must be compared against all possible pairs for validity.  
For small and medium constraints, the brute-force approach is acceptable—it is simple, clear, and doesn’t require extra data structures.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty array: No pairs, return 0.  
- Single element: Pair with itself, XOR is 0.  
- All elements equal: All pairs have XOR 0.  
- Large differences in elements: Only some pairs may be valid strong pairs.  
- Negative numbers (if allowed): Check if relative conditions still hold.

### Solution

```python
def maximumStrongPairXor(nums):
    max_xor = 0
    n = len(nums)
    # Try all pairs (i, j) including i == j
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            x, y = nums[i], nums[j]
            if abs(x - y) <= min(x, y):
                candidate = x ^ y
                if candidate > max_xor:
                    max_xor = candidate
    return max_xor
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²). For every element, we check all others (including itself), with simple arithmetic and bitwise operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). No extra space is required except for variables.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would your solution change if you needed to list all strong pairs with the maximum XOR?  
  *Hint: Store all pairs as you compute max XOR, not just the value.*

- Can you solve this faster than O(n²) if the array is sorted or only positive numbers?  
  *Hint: Try to bound candidate pairs using the condition.*

- What if you need to answer this query for multiple different arrays (batches)?  
  *Hint: Preprocessing, or see if data structure like Trie could help speed up multiple queries.*

### Summary
The core approach here is brute-force pair checking, which is justified by the relatively simple definition of the "strong pair" condition (abs(x-y) ≤ min(x,y)).  
The coding pattern is classic double-loop enumeration—common in "all pairs" situations where each pair must be validated by a custom condition.  
This pattern applies to a number of similar problems, including pair sums, pair differences, or pair relations constrained by both elements' values.  
For more advanced or tighter constraints, sorting or tries (for XOR queries) may provide faster solutions.
