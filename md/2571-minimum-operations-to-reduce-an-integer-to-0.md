### Leetcode 2571 (Medium): Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0 [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-an-integer-to-0)

### Description  
Given a positive integer **n**, you can perform any number of the following operation:  
- Either **add** or **subtract** any power of 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, ...) to or from **n**.  
Your goal is to determine the **minimum number of operations** needed to reduce **n** to 0.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 39`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:  
1. Add 1 (2⁰) to n: 39 ➔ 40  
2. Subtract 8 (2³): 40 ➔ 32  
3. Subtract 32 (2⁵): 32 ➔ 0  
So, minimum operations = 3.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 54`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:  
1. Add 2 (2¹) to n: 54 ➔ 56  
2. Add 8 (2³): 56 ➔ 64  
3. Subtract 64 (2⁶): 64 ➔ 0  
So, minimum operations = 3.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 15`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation:  
1. Subtract 8 (2³): 15 ➔ 7  
2. Subtract 4 (2²): 7 ➔ 3  
3. Subtract 2 (2¹): 3 ➔ 1  
4. Subtract 1 (2⁰): 1 ➔ 0  
So, minimum operations = 4.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force idea:**  
  Try every combination of adding or subtracting powers of 2 at each step (DFS/BFS). But this is highly inefficient: the state space explodes for large n.

- **Observation:**  
  Powers of 2 relate closely to binary representation. Each operation can flip a bit by adding/subtracting the power of 2 corresponding to that bit. If we only subtract, the number of operations would equal the count of 1s in binary (the popcount/Hamming weight).

- **But...**  
  We are allowed to **add** as well, not just subtract.  
  To minimize operations, sometimes it might be beneficial to "carry" (by adding to create runs of zeros and a single 1 to subtract), similar to how addition/subtraction works in binary.

- **Optimization:**  
  Use **greedy + bit manipulation** to make optimal local choices:  
  - If the current bit is 0, divide n by 2 (right shift).
  - If the current bit is 1:  
    - Either subtract 1 (if next bit is 0), **or**  
    - Add 1 (creating a carry), making the next bit 0 and reducing later operations.  
    - Repeat until n = 0, counting each step.

- **Why?**  
  This approach is optimal because, at each step, we handle the lowest nonzero bit in the binary representation and operate to make higher bits easier to clear with fewer operations.

### Corner cases to consider  
- **n = 0**: Already zero, no operations.
- **n is a power of 2**: Only 1 step needed (subtract n itself).
- **n is 1**: Only one subtraction.
- **Alternate runs of 1s and 0s**: Make sure add/subtract is optimal.
- **Large n**: Ensure efficiency and no overflow.
- **Multiple carry situations**: Large clusters of 1s in binary.

### Solution

```python
def min_operations(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Greedy + bit manipulation: At every step, decide to add or subtract 1 (2⁰), aiming to minimize carry.
    If n is even: right shift (n //= 2).
    If n is odd:
      - If second lowest bit is 0 or n == 1, subtract 1 (reduces operation).
      - Else, add 1 (cause a carry, potentially reducing total ops).
    """
    ops = 0
    while n != 0:
        if n & 1 == 0:
            n //= 2
        else:
            # Check if either n == 1 or next bit is 0 (no need to carry)
            if n == 1 or (n & 2) == 0:
                n -= 1
            else:
                n += 1
            ops += 1
    return ops
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
  Since each operation either halves n or reduces the number of set bits, it takes at most as many steps as there are bits in n.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  Only a constant number of variables; no extra storage or recursion.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you can only **subtract**, not add, any power of 2 each operation?  
  *Hint: Greedy subtract the largest possible power of 2; popcount of n.*

- What if **subtracting** a power of 2 has a **different cost/weight** for each k?  
  *Hint: Dynamic Programming, similar to coin change.*

- Can you extend this approach to **any base b**, not just base 2?  
  *Hint: The pattern generalizes; need to adapt carry/borrow logic to base b.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic **greedy bit manipulation** challenge, similar to popcount with enhanced flexibility due to the add operation. The main trick is optimally managing carries by sometimes incrementing n to reduce future operations, echoing concepts from binary addition/subtraction.  
The technique is widely useful for "minimum steps to zero" problems, and the core idea generalizes to manipulations in other bases and coin change-type DP problems.
