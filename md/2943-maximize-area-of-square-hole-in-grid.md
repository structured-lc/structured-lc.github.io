### Leetcode 2943 (Medium): Maximize Area of Square Hole in Grid [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-area-of-square-hole-in-grid)

### Description  
Given a grid formed by (n+2) horizontal and (m+2) vertical bars (so the grid is n rows by m columns of 1×1 cells), some horizontal (hBars) and some vertical (vBars) bars can be removed. Each list contains bar indices that can be removed (ranging from 2 to n+1 for horizontal, and 2 to m+1 for vertical).  
A *square hole* is a square-shaped region of contiguous unit cells formed by removing a contiguous block of horizontal bars and a contiguous block of vertical bars. Return the maximal possible area (side²) for such a square hole.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 2, m = 1, hBars = [2,3], vBars = [2]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: Can remove horizontal bars 2, 3 and vertical bar 2. The side length is 2 (2 consecutive hBars, 1 consecutive vBar). Area = 2 × 2 = 4.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 1, m = 1, hBars = [2], vBars = [2]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: Can remove horizontal bar 2 and vertical bar 2, both consecutive, so side length 1. But the area is 1 × 1 = 1?*  
(But the correct answer is 4 since the grid is 1×1, removing both makes a 2×2 square. See note at the end.)

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 2, m = 2, hBars = [2], vBars = [2,3]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Only one horizontal bar can be removed, so max streak horizontally is 1. For the vertical, we can remove both, but ultimately the largest square is 1×1, so area = 1.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The problem is about maximizing the area of a square hole by removing some bars. The "hole" is defined by the longest consecutive block of removable horizontal bars and the longest consecutive block of removable vertical bars.
- Brute-force would be:  
  - Try all possible combinations of removable bars, but this is infeasible for large input as it is exponential.
- Instead, we can notice that the maximal square hole is constrained by the length of the *longest consecutive subsequence* in *both* hBars and vBars.  
  - For example, if you can remove {2,3,4} horizontal bars consecutively, that’s a streak of length 3 (number of bars removed). This opens up 3+1 = 4 consecutive rows (because removing bars 2,3,4 means you have a hole from row 1 to 5).
  - Same logic for vertical bars.
- So, to maximize the side length, find the longest consecutive streak in hBars, call this length hLen, and the longest streak in vBars, vLen. Then, the maximal square is side = min(hLen, vLen) + 1.  
  - The “+1” comes from remembering that if you remove k consecutive bars, the hole has (k+1) rows/columns open.
- Therefore,  
  1. Sort hBars and vBars.
  2. For each, find the maximal length of consecutive streaks.
  3. The answer is the square of (min of the two streak lengths + 1).
- This approach is O(N log N + M log M) due to sorting.

### Corner cases to consider  
- hBars or vBars is empty (no streak possible, only 1 row/col open).
- All bars in hBars or vBars are consecutive (maximal possible hole).
- Only one bar in hBars or vBars (streak = 1, hole area = 4).
- Grid is 1×1, all bars removable.
- Unsorted input for hBars/vBars.
- n or m is very large, but hBars or vBars are small/empty.

### Solution

```python
def maximizeSquareHoleArea(n, m, hBars, vBars):
    # Helper to find length of longest consecutive streak in a sorted array
    def max_consecutive_length(arr):
        if not arr:
            return 0
        arr.sort()
        max_streak = streak = 1
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == arr[i-1] + 1:
                streak += 1
            else:
                streak = 1
            max_streak = max(max_streak, streak)
        return max_streak

    max_h = max_consecutive_length(hBars)
    max_v = max_consecutive_length(vBars)
    # If max_consecutive_length is k, streak removes k bars ==> opens up k+1 rows/columns
    side = min(max_h, max_v) + 1 if max_h and max_v else 1
    return side * side
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(N log N + M log M)  
  N is the size of hBars, M is the size of vBars, for sorting each and scanning for streaks.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra apart from input (ignoring sorting, which may use O(N+M) time/space for the sort).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you wanted the largest *rectangular* hole, not necessarily square?  
  *Hint: Track the max consecutive streaks in each direction individually and use both.*

- What if removal of bars has a cost, and you have a budget?  
  *Hint: Formulate as "sliding window" over sorted arrays within the budget.*

- How would your solution change if you could remove non-consecutive sets of bars?  
  *Hint: The "hole" wouldn't be a neat square—problem structure changes.*

### Summary
This problem follows a *streaks and intervals* pattern, reducing the solution to finding longest consecutive streaks in sorted arrays. The key insight is recognizing that the largest square depends on the minimum of the biggest consecutive blocks of removable horizontal/vertical bars (plus one). This pattern arises often in grid-cutting or chessboard-hole style problems, where consecutive operations map to maximal region exposures. It’s a classic interval-streak analysis, useful for many grid, streak, or marking-style questions.
