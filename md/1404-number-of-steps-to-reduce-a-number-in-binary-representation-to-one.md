### Leetcode 1404 (Medium): Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one)

### Description  
Given a binary string `s` representing a positive integer, you must perform these steps until you reach '1':
- If the current number is even, divide it by 2.
- If it's odd, add 1.
Return the number of steps required to reduce the binary number to 1.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "1101"`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation: "1101" (13), odd → add 1 = 14 ("1110"), even → /2 = 7 ("111"), odd → +1 = 8 ("1000"), even → /2 = 4 ("100"), even → /2 = 2 ("10"), even → /2 = 1 ("1").*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "10"`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: "10" (2), even → /2 = 1, done.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = "1"`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: Already 1, no steps needed.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The rules mirror the Collatz sequence but only in base-2.
- Since dividing by 2 in binary means removing the trailing '0', and adding 1 to an odd number will add a carry. We can process from the end of the string simulating steps without converting to integer (for very long s).
- For each bit, count steps: if rightmost bit is '0', remove it (/2), if '1', flip to '0' (+1), and propagate carries as needed.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Input '1': already done.
- Very long binary strings.
- All bits '1', requiring cascaded carries (e.g. "111...1").
- All bits are zeros except leading '1'.

### Solution

```python
def numSteps(s: str) -> int:
    steps = 0
    carry = 0
    n = len(s)
    # Process from right to left
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if int(s[i]) + carry == 1:
            # Odd: needs +1 then /2
            carry = 1
            steps += 2
        else:
            # Even: can divide by 2
            steps += 1
    # After loop: add carry if any
    steps += carry
    return steps
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) — One scan through the binary string.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — Only a few integer variables.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle very large binary strings (like 10⁵ bits)?  
  *Hint: Avoid conversions, operate bit by bit.*

- Can you output the intermediate binary values for each step?  
  *Hint: Simulate operations and build new strings as needed.*

- How is this different from the classic "number of steps to reduce a number to one" in base-10?  
  *Hint: What changes if you use a different base and different rules?*

### Summary
This is a simulation problem leveraging binary properties: bit manipulations and step counting. Working from right to left allows you to handle potential carries efficiently without converting to integers.
