### Leetcode 1457 (Medium): Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree)

### Description  
Given a binary tree where each node contains a digit from 1 to 9, count the number of root-to-leaf paths such that the values along the path can be rearranged to form a palindrome. That is, determine if there exists a permutation of node values along the path that reads the same forward and backward.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `[2,3,1,3,1,null,1]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Paths are [2,3,3], [2,1,1], and [2,3,1]. Only [2,3,3] and [2,1,1] can be rearranged into palindromes ([3,2,3], [1,2,1]).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `[2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Valid path is [2,1,1], which can be rearranged to [1,2,1]. Other paths can’t be rearranged into a palindrome.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: ``  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Single node path  is trivially palindromic.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- Each **root-to-leaf path** needs to be checked.
- For a sequence to be palindromic after rearrangement, **at most one digit has an odd count** (for odd-length, the center; for even-length, all even).
- Use **DFS** to traverse all root-to-leaf paths.
- To avoid counting frequencies at every node (inefficient), use **bit masking:** maintain a bitmask for the parity (odd/even) of each digit along the path. Toggle the mask at each node.
- When at a leaf node, **if at most one bit is set** in the mask, the path is pseudo-palindromic.
- Count such paths.
- Bitmasking makes space and path checks efficient compared to storing and counting arrays for every path.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Single node tree
- Tree with only left or only right children
- All node values are the same
- No pseudo-palindromic paths possible

### Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths (self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node, mask):
            if not node:
                return 0
            # Toggle the bit for the current node value
            mask ^= (1 << node.val)
            # If it's a leaf, check if at most one bit is set in mask
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                if mask & (mask - 1) == 0:
                    return 1
                return 0
            # Continue DFS on children
            return dfs(node.left, mask) + dfs(node.right, mask)
        return dfs(root, 0)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(N) where N = number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H) for recursion stack, where H = height of the tree (balanced: O(logN), skewed: O(N)). The bitmask is a fixed size (integers for values 1-9).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  
- How would you handle the case if node values could be any integer, not just 1-9?  
  *Hint: Can't use a fixed-size bitmask, may need dictionaries for counting.*
- Can you do this iteratively instead of recursively?  
  *Hint: Use an explicit stack to simulate DFS and pass bitmask state.*
- What if you must return the actual paths, not just the count?  
  *Hint: Maintain the path traversal, not only the mask.*

### Summary
This problem uses the tree/DFS traversal pattern and bitmasking to efficiently check the palindromic property without expensive frequency counts at every node. The core technique (bitmask for checking parity of counts) generalizes to sequence parity problems on small, fixed value ranges.
