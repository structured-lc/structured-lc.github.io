### Leetcode 3406 (Hard): Find the Lexicographically Largest String From the Box II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-lexicographically-largest-string-from-the-box-ii)

### Description  
Suppose you’re given a string `word` and an integer `numFriends`. The string should be split into exactly `numFriends` non-empty parts such that every split across all possible rounds is unique (no duplicate splits). In each round, after splitting, all of the resulting pieces are thrown into a box. After all possible rounds, you need to find the **lexicographically largest** string that ever appeared in the box.  
A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than string `b` if, at the first differing position, `a` has a letter coming earlier in the alphabet, or if all letters are the same up to the length of the shorter string and `a` is shorter than `b`.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `word = "dbca", numFriends = 2`  
Output: `dbc`  
Explanation:  
All possible splits are:  
- "d" + "bca" ⇒ box: "d", "bca"  
- "db" + "ca" ⇒ box: "db", "ca"  
- "dbc" + "a" ⇒ box: "dbc", "a"  
The largest string among all is `"dbc"`.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `word = "gggg", numFriends = 4`  
Output: `g`  
Explanation:  
The only split is "g" + "g" + "g" + "g".  
The only box contents are all `"g"`, so output is `"g"`.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `word = "abcde", numFriends = 3`  
Output: `cde`  
Explanation:  
Possible splits include:  
- "a", "b", "cde" → box: "a", "b", "cde"  
- "a", "bc", "de" → box: "a", "bc", "de"  
- "ab", "c", "de" → box: "ab", "c", "de"  
- "ab", "cd", "e" → box: "ab", "cd", "e"  
- "abc", "d", "e" → box: "abc", "d", "e"  
The biggest is `"cde"`.


### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute Force:**  
  Consider generating every possible split of `word` into `numFriends` non-empty parts (combinatorial: need to choose `numFriends-1` cut points). After gathering all possible substrings produced, select the lexicographically largest. This is exponential time for large word sizes—definitely not practical for the input constraints.

- **Optimization:**  
  Since we need only the largest string from all possible substrings generated among all possible splits, we can observe:  
  - The largest substring to ever appear in any split is always a contiguous substring.  
  - There could be splits where one part is made much bigger (e.g., length ≥ word.length - numFriends + 1), so the largest substring can be up to this length (since we cannot have a part longer than the word, and the shortest possible other parts would be length 1).  
  - Thus, for every substring of `word` of length ≥ ⌊n / numFriends⌋, it could be possible for that string to be a part.

- **Greedy Insight (from optimal solution):**  
  For any substring that possibly appears in any split, the **lexicographically largest substring** that can be a part of a split with at least length ≥ (word.length - numFriends + 1) is the answer.  
  To find it efficiently, slide a window of length (word.length - numFriends + 1) and find the lex largest among all such substrings (and with fewer friends, larger windows).  
  Edge case: if numFriends == 1, the answer is the whole word.

- **Trade-offs:**  
  This approach reduces the exponential search to linear scan, as only (n - window + 1) substrings need to be checked.


### Corner cases to consider  
- All identical letters, e.g., "aaaa", any numFriends.
- numFriends == len(word): every split must be individual letters.
- numFriends == 1: answer is the word itself.
- Word length is very small or 1.
- Word is already sorted lexicographically.


### Solution

```python
def answerString(word: str, numFriends: int) -> str:
    n = len(word)
    # If there's only 1 friend, the whole word is taken as is
    if numFriends == 1:
        return word

    # The largest substring size possible in a split is n - numFriends + 1
    max_len = n - numFriends + 1
    ans = ''
    for i in range(n - max_len + 1):
        part = word[i:i + max_len]
        if part > ans:
            ans = part
    return ans
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n = len(word).  
  We slide a window of length (n - numFriends + 1) over the word and compare substrings.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space (excluding input/output).  
  We store only the current max substring. No recursion or significant extra structures.


### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you had to return **all** such largest substrings instead of just one?  
  *Hint: Keep a set of all equally maximal substrings as you scan.*

- What if you were to handle **very large** strings (streaming, or input does not fit in memory)?  
  *Hint: Use online/windowed scanning; do not materialize substrings; keep track of prefix max/lazy string comparison.*

- How would the process change if the parts do **not** need to be contiguous?  
  *Hint: This would be a very different combinatorial problem, not sliding window; requires generating combinations.*


### Summary
This problem is a classic instance of **sliding window on strings**: find the largest contiguous substring of a certain length, which is an efficient pattern for extracting maximal substrings. The reasoning leverages constraints on how splits can be made, focusing the search to only the meaningful window sizes. Similar patterns occur in substring, windowing problems, and bioinformatics (finding repeated motifs).
