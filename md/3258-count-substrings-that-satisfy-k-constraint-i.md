### Leetcode 3258 (Easy): Count Substrings That Satisfy K-Constraint I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-that-satisfy-k-constraint-i)

### Description  
Given a **binary string** s and an integer k, count the number of **non-empty substrings** of s that satisfy the **k-constraint**:  
- The number of ‘0’s in the substring is **at most k**, **or**
- The number of ‘1’s in the substring is **at most k**.  
Return the total count of such substrings.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "10101", k = 1`  
Output: `12`  
Explanation: Every substring except `"1010"`, `"10101"`, and `"0101"` satisfies the k-constraint.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "1010101", k = 2`  
Output: `25`  
Explanation: All substrings with length ≤ 5 satisfy the k-constraint. Substrings that are longer have too many zeros and ones.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = "11111", k = 1`  
Output: `15`  
Explanation: Every substring consists of only ‘1’s; for any `k ≥ 1` all substrings are valid.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
Start by brute-forcing:  
- For all substrings (there are n(n+1)/2 of them), count zeros and ones. For length up to 50, this is feasible.
- For each substring, increment zeros/ones counters, break early if both exceed k.

Then consider a more optimal approach using sliding window:
- Track the number of zeros and ones in the current window.
- For every right boundary, expand the window and increment counts; if both counts exceed k, move the left boundary right until it’s valid.
- For each valid window [left, right], all substrings ending at ‘right’ and starting between left and right are valid, so add (right - left + 1) to the answer.
- This runs in O(n²) in the worst case (since each substring may need to be checked), but is efficient and simple for n ≤ 50.

Choose the explicit double-for loop for clarity with early break, as the constraints allow brute force. Sliding window isn’t strictly needed since the brute-force is already O(n²).

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty string: not possible, since 1 ≤ s.length.
- String of only ‘0’s or only ‘1’s.
- k ≥ n: all substrings are valid.
- k = 1: only single runs or pairs, invalidates anything with more than one 0 and one 1.
- Alternating string (like "101010…").
- s of length 1.

### Solution

```python
def countKConstraintSubstrings(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    # Loop through all possible starting positions
    for i in range(n):
        zeros = 0
        ones = 0
        # Expand the substring ending at j
        for j in range(i, n):
            if s[j] == '0':
                zeros += 1
            else:
                ones += 1
            # If both counts are above k, break early
            if zeros > k and ones > k:
                break
            count += 1
    return count
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
  Each start index can extend to every end index, but early break improves average runtime. Acceptable since n ≤ 50.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  Only a few integer counters used. No extra data structures except for the input.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if s is much larger (n up to 10⁶)?
  *Hint: Consider a true sliding window or prefix sum optimizations.*

- How would you handle the case where s contains non-binary characters?
  *Hint: Add validation and skip/break for invalid substrings.*

- Can you solve for the longest valid substring, instead of counting substrings?
  *Hint: Use window expansion and track maximum length encountered.*

### Summary
This problem uses a nested loop (brute force with early exit per substring) to count substrings that satisfy simple binary constraints.  
It highlights the **substring enumeration** and **early break** optimization pattern appropriate under small constraints.  
Similar logic frequently appears in substring analysis, e.g., counting substrings that contain at most k distinct characters, sliding window for longest subarray, etc.
