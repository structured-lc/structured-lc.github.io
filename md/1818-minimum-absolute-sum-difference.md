### Leetcode 1818 (Medium): Minimum Absolute Sum Difference [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-sum-difference)

### Description  
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length. You can replace at most one element of nums1 with any element from nums1 to minimize the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements. Return the minimum possible sum of absolute differences.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums1 = [1,7,5], nums2 = [2,3,5]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Original sum = |1-2| + |7-3| + |5-5| = 1 + 4 + 0 = 5. Replace nums1[1] = 7 with nums1[0] = 1, giving |1-2| + |1-3| + |5-5| = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums1 = [2,4,6,8,10], nums2 = [2,4,6,8,10]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: Arrays are identical, so sum is already 0.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums1 = [1,10,4,4,2,7], nums2 = [9,3,5,1,7,4]`  
Output: `20`  
*Explanation: Original sum = |1-9| + |10-3| + |4-5| + |4-1| + |2-7| + |7-4| = 8 + 7 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 27. The best single replacement gives us a final sum of 20.*

### Thought Process (as if you're the interviewee)  
This problem asks me to find the single best replacement in nums1 to minimize the total sum of absolute differences.

**Key insights:**
1. **Calculate the baseline**: Compute the original sum first
2. **One replacement only**: I can replace at most one element, so I need to find which replacement gives maximum benefit
3. **For each position i**: Calculate how much benefit I get by replacing nums1[i] with the best possible element from nums1
4. **Optimization**: For position i, the best replacement is the element in nums1 closest to nums2[i]

**Approach:**
1. Sort nums1 to enable binary search
2. For each position i, use binary search to find the element in nums1 closest to nums2[i]  
3. Calculate the benefit: original_diff - new_diff
4. Track the maximum benefit across all positions
5. Return original_sum - max_benefit

This avoids O(nÂ²) brute force by using O(log n) binary search for each position.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Arrays with identical elements
- Single element arrays
- No beneficial replacement exists
- Multiple optimal replacements
- Large numbers causing integer overflow
- All elements in nums1 are the same

### Solution

```python
# Just like in interviews, please do not use python libraries to take shortcuts.
# They aren't usually allowed in real interviews.
# Add comments to each step of your logic

def minimumAbsoluteSumDiff(nums1, nums2):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(nums1)
    
    # Calculate original sum
    original_sum = sum(abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]) for i in range(n))
    
    # Create sorted version of nums1 for binary search
    sorted_nums1 = sorted(set(nums1))  # Remove duplicates for efficiency
    
    max_benefit = 0
    
    # Try replacing each position
    for i in range(n):
        current_diff = abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i])
        target = nums2[i]
        
        # Find the closest element in nums1 to nums2[i] using binary search
        # We need to check both floor and ceiling values
        
        # Binary search for the insertion point
        left, right = 0, len(sorted_nums1)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if sorted_nums1[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        
        # Check the closest candidates
        candidates = []
        if left < len(sorted_nums1):  # ceiling (smallest >= target)
            candidates.append(sorted_nums1[left])
        if left > 0:  # floor (largest < target)
            candidates.append(sorted_nums1[left - 1])
        
        # Find the best replacement that gives maximum benefit
        for candidate in candidates:
            new_diff = abs(candidate - target)
            benefit = current_diff - new_diff
            max_benefit = max(max_benefit, benefit)
    
    result = original_sum - max_benefit
    return result % MOD
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) for sorting nums1 initially, plus O(n log n) for n binary searches (each taking O(log n)), giving O(n log n) overall.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the sorted copy of nums1. Using set() to remove duplicates can reduce space in practice but doesn't change the worst-case complexity.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you're the interviewer)  

- Can you solve this if nums1 was already sorted?  
  *Hint: You still need O(n log n) time due to the n binary searches, but you save the initial sorting step.*

- How would you handle the case where you can replace k elements instead of just one?  
  *Hint: Use dynamic programming or greedy approach to select k best replacements.*

- What if the arrays were very large and couldn't fit in memory?  
  *Hint: Consider streaming approaches or external sorting techniques.*

### Summary
This problem combines binary search optimization with greedy selection. The key insight is that for each position, we only need to check the closest elements in the sorted array rather than all possible replacements. This pattern appears in problems involving finding optimal replacements, closest values, and minimizing sums through strategic swaps.
