### Leetcode 3489 (Medium): Zero Array Transformation IV [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/zero-array-transformation-iv)

### Description  
Given an integer array **nums** of length n and a 2D array **queries**, where queries[i] = [lᵢ, rᵢ, valᵢ], each query lets you select any subset of indices in the range lᵢ to rᵢ (inclusive) and decrease those nums by exactly valᵢ.  
You must process the queries in order. After exactly k queries, if you can turn **nums** into an array of all zeros, return the smallest such non-negative k (1-based, i.e., after k queries). If impossible, return -1.  
You do NOT have to use every decrement possible in a query—you can pick which indices to apply within the given range.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [2,0,2]`, `queries = [[0,2,1],[0,2,1],[1,1,3]]`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:*
- After the first query (`[0,2,1]`): decrement nums and nums[2] by 1 each → `[1,0,1]`
- After the second query (`[0,2,1]`): decrement nums and nums[2] by 1 each → `[0,0,0]` (reached all zeros in 2 steps)

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [3,1,4]`, `queries = [[0,1,1],[2,2,2],[0,2,1]]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:*
- 1ᵗʰ query (`[0,1,1]`): decrement nums by 1 → `[2,1,4]`
- 2ⁿᵈ query (`[2,2,2]`): decrement nums[2] by 2 → `[2,1,2]`
- 3ʳᵈ query (`[0,2,1]`): decrement nums and nums[2] by 1 each → `[1,1,1]`
  (But it’s not all-zero, but if you choose both in all steps, maybe with another selection, try all combinations. But the optimal way is to apply decrements optimally so that after third query it's all zeros.)

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`, `queries = [[0,2,1],[0,2,1]]`  
Output: `-1`  
*Explanation:*
- No matter how you apply the decrements, there is no way to reach all zero array after any number of queries.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute-force idea:**  
  - Try all possible ways to apply decrements in each query to every subset of indices in the allowed range.
  - Too slow, since number of ways grows exponentially.

- **Optimization:**  
  - Since we process queries in sequence and each query allows us to decrement by valᵢ on any subset, the key observation is:  
    For each query, for every index in the range lᵢ..rᵢ, we can choose to decrement that index or not.
  - The main challenge is to decide, for each position, which queries to use up (and how many times) to zero out every position by the end of k queries.
  - This can be formulated as a “cover the vector with allowed differences” problem or interval DP.
  - Since constraints are small (`n` and number of queries both ≤ 10; else this approach would not work efficiently),  
    Iterate through all possible numbers of queries k from 1 up to len(queries).  
    For each k, attempt to solve the corresponding system: can we choose subsets in the first k queries such that each element nums[i] is sum of val_j for queries j that cover i?

- **Final Approach:**  
  - For each prefix of queries (first k), build a list for each index of which queries affect it.
  - For each index, nums[i] must be zeroed using only sum of val's from the queries that affect i.
  - Viewing as a subset sum (with repeated elements), check: is there a way to use some of the available queries covering each index to exactly zero it?  
  - Use bitmask dynamic programming where possible (since n is small), otherwise try backtracking for small enough query size.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty nums or queries  
- nums already all zeros at start  
- Impossible to cover some positions with available queries  
- Each query allows multiple choices (optional for each index)  
- Overlapping queries with large decrements (can overshoot zero?)  
- nums with negative, zero or positive integers

### Solution

```python
def minOperations(nums, queries):
    n = len(nums)
    m = len(queries)
    
    # For each k (1 to m), try to solve the subproblem using first k queries
    for k in range(1, m + 1):
        # For each index, collect val for each query covering it (up to k)
        covers = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for j in range(k):
            l, r, val = queries[j]
            for i in range(l, r + 1):
                covers[i].append(val)
        
        # DP[i][s] = can we reach sum s at index i with its cover values
        possible = True
        for idx in range(n):
            target = nums[idx]
            vals = covers[idx]
            # subset sum: can we choose any subset of vals to sum to target?
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True
            for v in vals:
                for s in range(target, v - 1, -1):
                    if dp[s - v]:
                        dp[s] = True
            if not dp[target]:
                possible = False
                break
        if possible:
            return k
    return -1
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(m × n × N)  
  - For each k (up to m), for each index (n), do subset-sum DP up to max(nums[i]).  
  - Acceptable if `n` and `m` are both ~10 and nums[i] ≤ 50.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n × N)  
  - For each position, a DP array up to nums[i] is used.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the input arrays are much larger (n, m up to 10⁴ or more)?  
  *Hint: Can you optimize with greedy or interval trees for faster sums?*

- What if queries have an extra "cost" and you want to minimize total cost, not query count?  
  *Hint: Try treating this as a weighted cover problem.*

- Can you retrieve the actual sequence of chosen indices/subsets for each query to achieve zero array?  
  *Hint: Extend the DP or backtracking to store reconstruction information.*

### Summary
This problem reduces to a *repeated subset-sum* problem with overlapping intervals, efficiently solvable by dynamic programming if `n` and queries are small. Core ideas here involve interval coverage, subset sum, and dynamic programming. Patterns like “can I achieve a set of targets with allowed overlapping intervals” are common in range/interval DP, backpack problems, and optimal covering algorithms.
