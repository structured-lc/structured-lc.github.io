### Leetcode 3524 (Medium): Find X Value of Array I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-x-value-of-array-i)

### Description  
Given an array of positive integers **nums** and an integer **k**, you are allowed to perform an operation once:  
- In each operation, you can **remove any (possibly empty) prefix and any (possibly empty) suffix** from nums so that the array remains non-empty.  
- The subarray that remains after removing the prefix and suffix is any possible non-empty subarray.

You need to compute, for every x from 0 to k - 1, the number of such contiguous subarrays whose product modulo k is x.  
Return an array **result** of size k, where result[x] is the answer for x.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `k = 3`  
Output: `[9,2,4]`  
*Explanation:*
- For x = 0: 9 subarrays where the product % 3 == 0.
- For x = 1: 2 subarrays where the product % 3 == 1.
- For x = 2: 4 subarrays where the product % 3 == 2.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [2,3,4]`, `k = 2`  
Output: `[3,3]`  
*Explanation:*
- For x = 0: Products of subarrays `[2]`, `[4]`, `[2,3]`, `[3,4]`, `[2,3,4]`, etc, and their mods counted up to 3.
- For x = 1: Remaining subarrays with product % 2 == 1, which are also 3 ways.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = `, `k = 5`  
Output: `[0,0,0,0,1]`  
*Explanation:*
- Only one subarray: ``. 7 % 5 = 2, so only result[2] = 1, rest are 0.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

First, clarify: for every non-empty subarray (contiguous), we count how many such have product % k == x for all x in 0...k-1.

**Brute-force approach:**  
- Enumerate all possible subarrays O(n²).
- For each, compute the product, then take product % k.
- For each x, increment result[x] if matches.
- **But** n can be large and products grow very fast; we need to optimize.

**Better approach (DP / prefix):**  
- Instead of recomputing product from scratch for each subarray:
    - We scan nums from left to right.
    - For each position, maintain how many subarrays ending at that position have each possible remainder.
- Let `prev[r]`: how many subarrays ending at previous element had product % k == r.
- For current num (`x`), we can extend each of the current subarrays:
    - For every t in 0...k-1:
        - product_mod = (t * x) % k
        - cur[product_mod] += prev[t]
- Also count the new single-element subarray: cur[x % k] += 1
- Update `ans[x]` by adding cur[x] at this step.
- Slide prev = cur as we go.

Each position is processed in O(k), so overall O(nk), which is efficient.

**Trade-offs:**  
- This avoids recomputation of subarray products.
- Product values never get too big since we just track the mod at each step.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty array (should not happen since array must stay non-empty after cuts).
- Single element (`nums = [x]`), various k.
- All values are 1 (product grows slowly, all products % k == 1 only).
- Large k (how does mod math hold, time complexity).
- k = 1 (all products mod 1 == 0).

### Solution

```python
def resultArray(nums, k):
    # Initialize answers for each remainder mod k
    ans = [0] * k
    # prev: for each remainder, count of subarrays ending at previous element
    prev = [0] * k

    for num in nums:
        r = num % k
        cur = [0] * k
        # Extend all subarrays ending previously with this number
        for t in range(k):
            next_mod = (t * r) % k
            cur[next_mod] += prev[t]
        # Single element subarray: num itself
        cur[r] += 1
        # Add current counts to answer and move cur to prev
        for t in range(k):
            ans[t] += cur[t]
            prev[t] = cur[t]
    return ans
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n × k), because for each of the n elements, we process an array of size k (0 ≤ t < k).
- **Space Complexity:** O(k), since prev, cur, and ans each use O(k) space.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you need to count for all possible products, not just % k?
  *Hint: Tracking full product history is not feasible for large nums or k, but for small constraints you can use hash maps.*

- Can you compute not just the count, but list the actual subarrays?
  *Hint: Store tuples or start/end indices, but memory will grow fast with n² subarrays.*

- How do you solve it when zeros are allowed in nums?
  *Hint: Special handling for zeros, as any subarray containing zero has product zero.*

### Summary
This approach uses a classic **prefix DP** pattern. For each new number, we carry over counts of previous subarrays by their modulo classes, updating using modular multiplication. This pattern is common for **counting subarrays with modular constraints**, and can be applied to problems like counting subarrays with sum or product divisible by k, or similar "modulo" based DP problems.
