### Leetcode 1611 (Hard): Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero)

### Description  
Given a non-negative integer `n`, you need to turn it into `0` using the minimum number of **special bit operations**. Each operation lets you pick any bit (possibly the most significant or any other) and flip it, but **only if all less significant bits are zero**. The operations behave recursively through bitwise manipulation. The goal: **how many such operations are needed to reduce `n` to zero?**

### Examples  
**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 3`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: 3 = 11₂. Flip left bit (positions: [1, 1] → [0, 1]) = 1 (01₂); then flip bit 0 (01₂ → 00₂).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 6`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: 6 = 110₂. 110 → 010 (flip 2ⁿᵈ bit), 010 → 011 (toggle 0ᵗʰ since right bits zero), 011 → 001, 001 → 000. Total 4 operations.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 0`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: Already zero, so no operations needed.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
Let’s examine the allowed operation:

- You may flip the iᵗʰ bit **only if** all bits less significant than `i` are zero.
- This operation is similar to a Gray code transformation, and recursion emerges naturally based on the highest active bit.
- **Brute-force:** Simulate all bit flips until `n` is 0: but the number of combinations is exponential in the number of bits — infeasible.
- **Optimized:** Observe the problem recursively. For example, for n with highest set bit at index k, flipping it requires first returning less significant bits to zero recursively (since we may introduce additional ones by flipping higher bits). This means `minimumOneBitOperations(n) = minimumOneBitOperations(n ^ (1 << k)) + (1 << k)`.
- Use memoization or direct recursion for efficiency — since only O(log n) unique subproblems exist.

### Corner cases to consider  
- n = 0 (no ops needed)
- Powers of two, like n = 8 (only one bit is set)
- Numbers with contiguous 1s (like n = 7)
- Large n near 2³¹
- Sparse bits set (e.g. n = 2 + 2²⁰)

### Solution

```python
def minimumOneBitOperations(n: int) -> int:
    # Recursively compute minimum one bit ops
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    # Find most significant bit position k
    k = n.bit_length() - 1
    # Use the recurrence: ops(n) = 2^k - ops(n ^ 2^k)
    return (1 << k) - minimumOneBitOperations(n ^ (1 << k))
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n), since we reduce n by the highest set bit each time, so at most one call per bit.
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) due to recursion stack (maximum stack depth ~number of bits in n).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  
- Can you solve it iteratively instead of recursively?  
  *Hint: Simulate the process from MSB to LSB with bitwise operations.*

- How would you find the highest set bit efficiently?  
  *Hint: Use n.bit_length() in Python, or integer log₂.*

- What if you want to reduce n to another integer m, not zero?  
  *Hint: Consider Gray code distance between n and m.*

### Summary
The key is recognizing the link to **Gray code sequences** and recursion based on the highest bit set. This pattern is a variation of bitmask dynamic programming and conditional flipping, a common advanced topic. The recursive, divide-and-conquer reduction pattern is useful for problems involving flipping or transforming bits to a desired state.
