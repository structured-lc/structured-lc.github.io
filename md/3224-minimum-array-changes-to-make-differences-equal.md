### Leetcode 3224 (Medium): Minimum Array Changes to Make Differences Equal [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-array-changes-to-make-differences-equal)

### Description  
Given an integer array **nums** of even length **n** and an integer **k** (all array elements are from 0 to k, inclusive), you can change any element to any number from 0 to k. Find the minimum number of changes needed so that for all valid pairs (i, n-1-i), the absolute difference abs(nums[i] - nums[n-1-i]) is equal for every pair.  
In other words: make it so that for all i (0 ≤ i < n/2), abs(nums[i] - nums[n-1-i]) = X for some fixed X.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,2,1], k = 2`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: Pairs (1,2) and (2,1) both have difference 1. No changes needed.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,1,2], k = 2`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Pair differences: (1,2)=1 and (1,2)=1, but to make abs difference 0, change nums to 2 and nums[3] to 1 (or vice versa): [2,2,1,1]. 2 changes.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [0,4,2,2], k = 4`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Pairs: (0,2) and (4,2). Differences are 2 and 2. But if first pair is changed to (2,2), only 1 change needed.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force approach:**  
  Try every possible difference X (0..k), and for each X, count how many elements need to be changed to make all pairs have this difference. For n/2 pairs, and k possible X, that’s O(k ⋅ n) time.
- **Optimizing:**  
  For each pair, figure out which values of X can be achieved by 0, 1, or 2 changes:
    - If their current abs difference is X, needs 0 changes for that X.
    - If we can change one element for that X (by moving one side to something 0..k), count as 1 change.
    - Else needs 2 changes.
  We can process all n/2 pairs, accumulate the change requirements for each possible X using a difference array, and use prefix sums to find for each X the minimal change count.
- **Why difference array?**  
  For each pair, update the change requirements in a range for 1 or 2 changes, and accumulate over all pairs.
- **Final approach:**  
  Use an array (length k+2). For each pair, process the interval for possible X’s where:
    - 0 change is needed at a single value (their current diff)
    - 1 change for the neighborhood interval
    - 2 changes elsewhere
  Take prefix sum and find the minimum value.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Array is empty (n=0)  
- All pairs already have the same difference  
- k = 0 or k = 1  
- Elements at extremes: either 0 or k  
- Maximum possible difference (k,0 pairs)  
- All elements are the same

### Solution

```python
def min_changes(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    max_diff = k
    change_count = [0] * (max_diff + 2)  # difference array
    pairs = n // 2

    for i in range(pairs):
        a = nums[i]
        b = nums[n - 1 - i]
        low = min(a, b)
        high = max(a, b)

        # At exactly X = high - low, 0 change needed
        change_count[high - low] += -1

        # For all other X in [0, high - low - 1]: needs 1 change
        change_count[0] += 1
        change_count[high - low] += -1

        # For X in [high - low + 1, max(high, k - low)]: needs 1 change
        min_x = high - low + 1
        max_x = max(high, k - low)
        if min_x <= max_x:
            change_count[min_x] += 1
            if max_x + 1 < len(change_count):
                change_count[max_x + 1] -= 1

        # For X in [max(high, k - low) + 1, k]: needs 2 changes
        if max_x + 1 <= k:
            change_count[max_x + 1] += 1
            if k + 1 < len(change_count):
                change_count[k + 1] -= 1

    # Now compute prefix sum and keep track of the minimal required change count
    res = float('inf')
    curr = 0
    for x in range(len(change_count) - 1):
        curr += change_count[x]
        res = min(res, curr + pairs)

    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + k). Each pair is processed in constant time, and then prefix sum over k+2 entries.
- **Space Complexity:** O(k). Uses a difference array of length k+2, plus small extra vars.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if k is very large (like 1e9)?  
  *Hint: Can you avoid O(k) space if you only need answers for reachable differences?*

- Could you find not just the minimum, but *all* possible values of X for which the minimum is achieved?  
  *Hint: Track where the minimum occurs while sweeping prefix sums.*

- How would you adapt to support online queries, where elements are changed one at a time?  
  *Hint: Consider segment trees or other dynamic range data structures.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic use-case for the **difference array and prefix sum** technique to efficiently count and combine change requirements over value ranges. The pattern is common in problems where a cost function is piecewise-constant or can be linearly swept over a parameter. Related patterns appear in interval counting, querying optimal thresholds, or minimizing total cost across several ranges.
