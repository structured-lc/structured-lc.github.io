### Leetcode 2317 (Medium): Maximum XOR After Operations  [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-after-operations)

### Description  
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can pick any non-negative integer x and any index i, and update `nums[i]` to `nums[i] AND (nums[i] XOR x)`. The task is to return the maximum possible bitwise XOR you can get from the array after performing any number of such operations.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [3,2,4,6]`  
Output: `7`  
*Explanation: Apply the operation with x=4 and i=3: nums[3] = 6 AND (6 XOR 4) = 6 AND 2 = 2. Now nums = [3,2,4,2]. XOR of all elements: 3 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 4 ⊕ 2 = 7. No operation can make the result higher.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Any operation cannot produce a maximum XOR greater than 3. Try: 1 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 3 = 0, but instead, do not change anything and 1 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 3 = 0, but you can tweak to get 3 by AND-ing numbers down to certain bits, maximizing relevant OR.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [5,1,7]`  
Output: `7`  
*Explanation: 5 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 7 = 3, but by using the allowed operation to selectively zero bits, you can reach maximum possible OR value which is 7 across the array.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- First, understand the operation: For any i and any x, you can replace `nums[i]` with `nums[i] AND (nums[i] XOR x)`.
- The effect is that you can clear bits from nums[i], but only where nums[i] originally had a 1.
- To maximize XOR, we want as many 1s as possible in each bit position across the numbers.
- If any number has a 1 in a particular bit position, using AND and XOR, we can force other numbers to have a 0 in that position, so that the XOR will keep that bit as 1 in the combined result, as long as it's present in any number.
- Ultimately, the maximal XOR you can achieve is the bitwise OR of the entire array: `nums | nums[1] | ... | nums[n-1]`.
  - If a bit appears in at least one number, by clearing all other bits in others, the XOR can achieve it.
- Thus, the answer is simply the bitwise OR of all elements.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All elements zero: output will be 0.
- All elements the same: output will be the value itself.
- Single element: output is just that element.
- Large numbers and wide bit positions: make sure OR covers all.

### Solution

```python
def maximumXOR(nums):
    # Start with 0, do a bitwise OR for all numbers
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result |= num  # set every bit that appears in any number
    return result
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in nums, since we loop through the list to compute the OR.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since only a constant amount of extra space is used regardless of input size.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Suppose we're restricted to a certain maximum number of operations. How does the answer change?  
  *Hint: Model each operation step-by-step to see how bits can be cleared; you may not always get the full OR in few steps.*

- What if instead of AND, the operation allowed was OR or XOR?  
  *Hint: For OR, all bits could be set; for XOR, very different possibilities emerge depending on parity.*

- Can you recover the specific sequence of operations that gives this maximum value, not just the value itself?  
  *Hint: Track which numbers are assigned to 0 or have bits cleared to cause the correct XOR.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic example of optimizing bitwise operations; the solution distills down to bitwise OR-ing all numbers to determine the maximum achievable XOR after any number of the allowed operations. This approach is efficient and generalizes to similar problems about controlling bits across an array using AND, OR, or XOR. This bit manipulation pattern also appears in minimized/maximum cover (set bits) problems in coding interviews.


### Flashcard
The max XOR is the bitwise OR of all numbers, since you can clear bits to maximize differing bits in the result.
