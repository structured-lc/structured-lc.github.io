### Leetcode 3143 (Medium): Maximum Points Inside the Square [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-inside-the-square)

### Description  
You are given a 2D array `points`, where each element represents the coordinates `[x, y]` of a point, and a string `s` where `s[i]` is the tag for the iᵗʰ point.  
A valid square is:
- Centered at the origin (0, 0)
- Edges parallel to the coordinate axes
- Contains no two points with the same tag within or on its boundary

Find the **maximum number of points** that can fit in such a valid square.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `points = [[1,1], [-1,-1], [2,2]], s = "aba"`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: Possible to include points at (1,1) with tag 'a' and (-1,-1) with tag 'b' into a square of side 2. But including all would require both ‘a’ tags, which is invalid.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `points = [[0,0], [1,2], [2,1]], s = "abc"`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: All three tags are unique and all points can be included within a square of side 2 centered at the origin.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `points = [[1,2], [2,1], [-1,-1], [-2,-2]], s = "aabb"`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: By taking (1,2) and [-1,-1], both tags ‘a’ and ‘b’ can be included (one of each). Including more would cause duplicate tags.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The brute-force way: Try all possible square sizes, for each, scan which points are inside; for each subset, check for tag uniqueness. This would be far too slow since the number of subsets grows exponentially.
- Optimized idea:
    - For each point, the minimum square (side) needed to include it is `max(abs(x), abs(y))`.
    - Sort/group points by this “distance” to the origin.
    - For each unique square size (in increasing order), attempt to include all points **up to** that distance, as long as all tags are unique.
    - At any step, if a duplicate tag is to be added, break—cannot go further: larger squares will only add more duplicates.
    - This is a greedy/layered inclusion approach, with uniqueness tracked using a set.

This approach leverages sorting/grouping by max(abs(x), abs(y)), ensuring O(n) time per point and only hitting each layer once. Space is efficient because tag counts are at most 26 (lowercase English letters).

### Corner cases to consider  
- All points with **unique tags**: All can be included together.
- All points at the same location but with **different** tags.
- Multiple points with **identical tags**: Only one per tag can be included, no matter how large the square.
- Square of size **zero** (side=0): Only the origin can be included if such a point exists.
- Empty input arrays: Should return 0.
- Tags not lowercase or unexpected tags (shouldn’t occur per constraints but should be robust).

### Solution

```python
def maxPointsInsideSquare(points, s):
    # Group points by their max(abs(x), abs(y)) "layer"
    groups = dict()
    for i, (x, y) in enumerate(points):
        key = max(abs(x), abs(y))
        if key not in groups:
            groups[key] = []
        groups[key].append(i)
        
    # Process increasing layer distance ("square sizes")
    seen_tags = set()
    ans = 0
    for dist in sorted(groups.keys()):
        for idx in groups[dist]:
            tag = s[idx]
            if tag in seen_tags:
                # Duplicate tag, cannot include any more
                return ans
            seen_tags.add(tag)
        ans += len(groups[dist])
        
    return ans
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of points. The most expensive step is sorting the distances; practically, if number of unique distances is small, almost O(n).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for grouping points by distances; at most O(26) for unique tags in a square (so O(1) for tags), but O(n) for the distance-indexed grouping dict.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If the tags were not guaranteed to be single lowercase letters but could be arbitrary strings, how does your tag tracking change?  
  *Hint: You'd need to switch the tag tracking from a fixed-length array to a set or hashmap.*

- What if the square was not always centered at (0,0)?  
  *Hint: Now you need to consider all possible placements; that's a much harder geometric search.*

- Could you find **one** arrangement with the **maximum number** of points, not just the count?  
  *Hint: Keep track of which points you select and return their indices in addition to the count.*

### Summary
This problem is an example of **grouping by boundary layers** and greedy set inclusion under uniqueness constraints.  
The key insight is associating each point with the smallest enclosing square, and growing the inclusion set layer by layer, halting when a duplicate tag occurs.  
The tagging uniqueness requirement blends classic geometric search with counting under constraints; the set pattern for uniqueness is a common one, and this approach is very efficient for "expand and check uniqueness as you go" types of problems.
