### Leetcode 3532 (Medium): Path Existence Queries in a Graph I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-existence-queries-in-a-graph-i)

### Description  
Given an array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer `maxDiff`, imagine a graph where node `i` (for 0 ≤ i < n) is connected to node `i+1` if `|nums[i] - nums[i+1]| ≤ maxDiff`.  
Given a set of queries where each query is a pair `[u, v]`, determine for every query whether there exists any path from node `u` to node `v` using the defined edges.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
nums=`[1,3,5,7,6]`, maxDiff=`2`, queries=`[[0,4],[1,2]]`  
Output:  
`[True, True]`  
Explanation:  
- For (0,4): 1→3→5→7→6, consecutive differences: 2,2,2,1 (all ≤ 2) ⇒ True  
- For (1,2): direct edge 3→5, difference is 2 (≤2) ⇒ True

**Example 2:**  
Input:  
nums=`[1,10,20,30]`, maxDiff=`5`, queries=`[[0,3]]`  
Output:  
`[False]`  
Explanation:  
- All consecutive differences (9,10,10) > 5  
- No connections, so 0 and 3 are disconnected ⇒ False

**Example 3:**  
Input:  
nums=`[5,3,9,7,10,8]`, maxDiff=`3`, queries=`[[0,1],[2,3],[1,4],[0,5]]`  
Output:  
`[True, True, False, False]`  
Explanation:  
- (0,1): 5→3, |5-3|=2 (≤3) ⇒ True  
- (2,3): 9→7, |9-7|=2 (≤3) ⇒ True  
- (1,4): path 3→9→7→10: 3→9 is 6 (>3), so disconnected ⇒ False  
- (0,5): 5→3 =2, but 3→9=6 (>3), cannot reach 5→...→8 ⇒ False

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute-force:**  
  For each query, perform BFS or DFS from u to see if we can reach v. This is slow: for Q queries, each taking up to O(n), overall O(Q × n) time.

- **Observation:**  
  Graph is a *connection of segments*—edges only connect directly adjacent nodes if difference condition holds.  
  The whole array breaks up into “connected segments”.

- **Optimized Solution:**  
  - Precompute the *connected components*—walk through nums and assign each node a group/component id.  
  - When abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1]) > maxDiff, start a new group.  
  - Once groups are labeled, for each query simply check if u and v are in same group.

- **Trade-offs:**  
  - *Easy to implement*, linear time O(n+q).
  - Space is O(n) for group ids, O(q) for output.

### Corner cases to consider  
- queries where u == v (should always return True)
- array of size 1  
- maxDiff = 0 (edges only when nums[i] == nums[i+1])
- multiple disconnected groups  
- empty queries
- all identical nums values  
- queries reference out-of-bounds (shouldn’t happen per constraints)

### Solution

```python
def pathExistenceQueries(n, nums, maxDiff, queries):
    # Precompute component/group ids
    group = [0] * n
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if abs(nums[i] - nums[i-1]) > maxDiff:
            count += 1   # new group
        group[i] = count

    # For each query, check if u and v are in the same group
    res = []
    for u, v in queries:
        res.append(group[u] == group[v])
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(n + q)  
  - O(n) to assign group/component ids as we walk through nums  
  - O(q) to answer each query

- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(n + q)  
  - O(n) for group id storage  
  - O(q) for query output

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the graph was not a linear chain but had random edges?
  *Hint: Union-Find/Disjoint Set would be generic for arbitrary edge lists.*

- Can you preprocess for dynamic updates (nums values change, or queries are online)?
  *Hint: Segment tree or DSU with rollback might help.*

- How would you answer if the difference condition was on squared (nums[i] - nums[j])**2 ≤ X?
  *Hint: Would your group-label approach still work?*

### Summary
This problem uses the connectivity component pattern—reduce path queries to “are u and v in the same group?”. It highlights *efficient preprocessing* to reduce repeated graph queries. This logic is general to situations where relation between adjacent elements defines connection, and is a variant of *connected components in array/chain* questions. Similar ideas show up in range queries, offline queries, and problems with “segments of sameness/difference.”
