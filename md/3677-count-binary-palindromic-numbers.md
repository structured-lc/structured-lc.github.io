### Leetcode 3677 (Hard): Count Binary Palindromic Numbers [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-palindromic-numbers)

### Description  
Given two integers, **low** and **high**, return the number of integers between low and high (inclusive) whose binary representations are palindromic (ignoring leading zeros).  
A **binary palindrome** is an integer whose binary form reads the same backward as forward, e.g., 5 (101), 9 (1001).

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `low = 1, high = 10`  
Output: `5`  
Explanation: 1 (1), 3 (11), 5 (101), 7 (111), 9 (1001) are binary palindromes.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `low = 10, high = 15`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: 9 (1001), 15 (1111) are binary palindromes between 10 and 15.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `low = 22, high = 33`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: 27 (11011), 31 (11111) are the only palindromes in this range.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute-force approach:**  
  For every integer n in [low, high], convert n to binary, check if it's palindromic by comparing against its reverse. Time complexity will be O(high - low + 1) × number of bits. Too slow if the range is large.

- **Optimization:**  
  Instead of checking every number, **generate all possible binary palindromic numbers** (numbers of the form P = int(binary_string + reversed_binary_string)), and count how many fall in the range [low, high].  
  This is much faster, because there are relatively few palindromic numbers in any integer interval compared to all numbers.

- **Approach:**  
  - For each possible binary length from len(bin(low)) to len(bin(high)), generate all possible palindromic numbers (odd and even lengths) **without leading zeros**.
  - For each, check if it's between low and high.
  - Count the ones that satisfy this.

- **Trade-off:**  
  Generates only valid numbers (very efficient), skips all non-palindromes. Requires careful construction to avoid missing palindromes at boundaries.

### Corner cases to consider  
- low = high (single number interval)
- low or high is itself a binary palindrome
- low = 0 (decide if 0 is considered a valid palindrome; usually yes since 0 in binary is 0, which is palindromic)
- No palindromic numbers in range (output should be 0)
- Very large intervals (need to be efficient)

### Solution

```python
def count_bin_palindromes(low: int, high: int) -> int:
    def is_palindrome(n):
        s = bin(n)[2:]
        return s == s[::-1]

    def generate_palindromes(max_n):
        # Collect all palindromic numbers ≤ max_n
        palindromes = []
        max_len = len(bin(max_n)) - 2  # number of bits
        for length in range(1, max_len + 1):
            half = (length + 1) // 2
            start = 1 << (half - 1)    # avoid leading zero
            end = 1 << half
            for root in range(start, end):
                s = bin(root)[2:]
                # Odd length: exclude last char in reverse half
                if length % 2 == 0:
                    pal_s = s + s[::-1]
                else:
                    pal_s = s + s[-2::-1]
                v = int(pal_s, 2)
                if v > max_n:
                    continue
                palindromes.append(v)
        return palindromes

    # Get count of palindromes ≤ high and subtract count < low
    def count_upto(n):
        if n < 0:
            return 0
        pals = generate_palindromes(n)
        # 0 is palindromic, add if in interval
        if n >= 0:
            pals.append(0)
        return len([x for x in pals if x <= n])

    return count_upto(high) - count_upto(low - 1)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(log₂(high)) × O(2^{⌊bits/2⌋}) ≈ O(√high).  
  Because for n bits, palindromic numbers are O(2^{n/2}). Only generating these makes it much faster than brute-force.  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(√high) to keep all palindromic numbers up to high.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you **find the kᵗʰ binary palindrome** efficiently?  
  *Hint: Use combinatorics to construct the kᵗʰ palindromic bit pattern directly.*

- How would you find **the sum of all palindromic numbers in [low, high]?**  
  *Hint: Sum as you generate the palindromes within bounds.*

- What changes if you needed to count **base-10 palindromes**, not binary?  
  *Hint: Modify generation to work with decimal digits, similar construction logic.*

### Summary
This problem leverages the **constructive generation of binary palindromes** rather than brute-force checking, using properties of binary palindromic structures and bit-manipulation. The approach is an application of *combinatorial search* and *bit operations*, and the constructive pattern occurs in other palindrome enumeration problems, such as generating kᵗʰ palindromes in base-N or finding palindromic IDs in a range.
