### Leetcode 3277 (Hard): Maximum XOR Score Subarray Queries [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-score-subarray-queries)

### Description  
You are given an integer array **nums** and a list of **queries**, where each `queries[i] = [lᵢ, rᵢ]`. For each query, your task is to consider the subarray `nums[lᵢ .. rᵢ]` and find the **maximum XOR score** of any subarray within that slice.

The XOR score of an array is defined by repeatedly applying the XOR operation to adjacent elements until only one value remains. For example, for `a = [x, y, z]`, the score is `((x ⊕ y) ⊕ (y ⊕ z))`. Effectively, for any subarray, the process is to start with the subarray, apply the XOR operation to every adjacent pair, and repeat this N-1 times until only one number is left.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [2,8,4,32,16,1]`, `queries = [[0,2],[1,4],[0,5]]`  
Output: `[12,60,60]`  
*Explanation*:  
- Query [0,2] → subarray `[2,8,4]`: Possible subarrays are `[2],[2,8],[2,8,4],,[8,4],[4]`. Their XOR scores are 2, 10, 12, 8, 12, 4. Maximum is 12.
- Query [1,4] → subarray `[8,4,32,16]`: Compute for all subarrays in this slice, maximum is 60.
- Query [0,5]: Compute for all subarrays; maximum is 60.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`, `queries = [[0,2],[1,3]]`  
Output: `[3,7]`  
*Explanation*:  
- Query [0,2] → `[1,2,3]` subarrays. Maximum final XOR score among all possible subarrays is 3.
- Query [1,3] → `[2,3,4]`. Maximum possible is 7.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [5,1]`, `queries = [[0,1],[0,0],[1,1]]`  
Output: `[4,5,1]`  
*Explanation*:  
- [0,1] → `[5,1]` and subarrays: `[5,1],[5],[1]`. XOR scores: 4, 5, 1. Maximum is 5.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

**Initial approach (brute-force):**
- For each query, generate all subarrays in nums[l..r].
- For each subarray, repeatedly apply XOR to adjacent pairs until one number remains (the *score*), and track the maximum found.
- Time complexity would be O(n³) per query—inefficient for large n!

**Optimization:**
- Notice that for an interval `[i, j]`, the “XOR score” as defined is actually the XOR of **all the elements in that subarray** (do some small examples to see why: each round reduces the array and finally, you reduce to the overall XOR).
- So, for any subarray, its *score* = nums[i] ⊕ nums[i+1] ⊕ ... ⊕ nums[j].
- To efficiently answer each query, precompute prefix XORs:
    - prefix_xor[i] = nums ⊕ nums[1] ⊕ ... ⊕ nums[i-1]
    - The XOR of subarray nums[i..j] = prefix_xor[j+1] ⊕ prefix_xor[i]
- For each query [l, r], enumerate all subarrays within [l,r], compute their XOR value using the prefix XOR array, and take the maximum.
- Optimize further: Precompute for all ranges and use DP to quickly answer the queries.
    - Build a DP table max_xor[i][j] = the maximum XOR value for subarrays nums[i..j].
    - Use dynamic programming with:
        - xor_val[i][j] = xor_val[i][j-1] ⊕ nums[j]
        - max_xor[i][j] = max(max_xor[i][j-1], xor_val[i][j])
- Precompute max_xor[i][j] for all i, j in O(n²), then answer queries in O(1) each.

**Trade-offs:**
- O(n²) preprocessing, O(1) query.
- Brute-force is O(n³) per query, which is impractical.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Query ranges of length 1 (single element).
- All elements equal.
- Very large or very small numbers.
- Empty queries.
- Full array as a query.
- Queries overlapping or repeated.
- Negative numbers (if input allowed).

### Solution

```python
from typing import List

def maximumSubarrayXor(nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(nums)
    # xor_val[i][j]: XOR of nums[i..j]
    xor_val = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
    # max_xor[i][j]: maximum XOR for subarrays in nums[i..j]
    max_xor = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Base cases: subarrays of length 1
    for i in range(n):
        xor_val[i][i] = nums[i]
        max_xor[i][i] = nums[i]
    
    # Fill DP tables
    for length in range(2, n+1):  # length of subarray
        for i in range(n-length+1):
            j = i + length - 1
            xor_val[i][j] = xor_val[i][j-1] ^ nums[j]
            max_xor[i][j] = max(max_xor[i][j-1], 
                                xor_val[i][j])  # max subarray xor ending at j
    
    # For left boundaries, propagate the maximums to cover all subarrays
    # For query [l, r], answer is the max in max_xor[l][r]
    # But also need to consider max_xor[i][r] for l ≤ i ≤ r
    # Let's preprocess so that max_xor[i][j] means the max xor for any subarray inside [i,j]
    for j in range(n):
        for i in range(j-1, -1, -1):
            max_xor[i][j] = max(max_xor[i][j], max_xor[i+1][j])
    
    # Answer queries
    answer = []
    for l, r in queries:
        answer.append(max_xor[l][r])
    return answer
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
    - Preprocessing DP tables: O(n²) for all pairings.
    - Each query: O(1).
    - Overall: O(n² + q).
- **Space Complexity:**  
    - O(n²) for the DP tables.  
    - Input and output storage is O(n + q).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If the array is extremely large (say n ≈ 10⁵) with many queries, can you do better than O(n²) preprocessing?  
  *Hint: Can you process queries online, or use segment trees/trie to get maximum xor in range?*

- What if the queries arrive one at a time, and you need to process them on the fly?  
  *Hint: Instead of DP, can a trie or segment tree with range-maximum queries help?*

- Can the solution be improved if the queries only ask for the global max xor subarray for the whole array (no ranges)?  
  *Hint: Kadane’s algorithm analogue for XOR, or prefix trie approach to max subarray xor.*

### Summary
This approach uses **prefix xor and dynamic programming** to precompute the maximum xor for any subarray in O(n²) time, enabling O(1) query responses. The DP table approach is common for range query problems when queries are known in advance and n is reasonable (≤ 1000–2000). The technique can be generalized to other range-maximum or range-query variants, and parallels max subarray sum/xor classical patterns. For even larger constraints, segment trees or prefix trie approaches would be considered.
