### Leetcode 2011 (Easy): Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations)

### Description  
Given an array of strings, each representing an operation ("++X", "X++", "--X", or "X--"), you will simulate applying these operations in order to an integer variable **x** that starts at 0. Each increment operation increases **x** by 1, and each decrement operation decreases **x** by 1. Return the final value of **x** after performing all the operations.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `["--X","X++","X++"]`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Start with x = 0.  
"--X" → x = 0 - 1 = -1  
"X++" → x = -1 + 1 = 0  
"X++" → x = 0 + 1 = 1*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `["++X","++X","X++"]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Start with x = 0.  
"++X" → x = 0 + 1 = 1  
"++X" → x = 1 + 1 = 2  
"X++" → x = 2 + 1 = 3*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `["X++","++X","--X","X--"]`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: Start with x = 0.  
"X++" → x = 0 + 1 = 1  
"++X" → x = 1 + 1 = 2  
"--X" → x = 2 - 1 = 1  
"X--" → x = 1 - 1 = 0*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The problem is a straightforward simulation: start from 0, read each operation, and adjust the value accordingly.
- The brute-force way is to simply loop through the list, for each string check whether it is an increment or decrement, and update the value of x.
- Every operation will always be either increment or decrement, and the checking can be as simple as comparing if `'+'` or `'-'` is present in the middle (the 2nd character).
- Optimizations are unnecessary, as the problem is O(n) by nature (you must process every operation), but you could use a more concise one-liner if desired for code brevity.
- No need for advanced data structures or algorithms; simple simulation is optimal here.
- Chosen approach: one loop, conditional check, and increment or decrement accordingly—easy to reason and maintain.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty operations list (though per problem constraints, input is at least length 1).
- All increments (should return the length of the list).
- All decrements (should return negative the length).
- Alternate increments and decrements (should correctly add up to zero if balanced).
- Large input size, but each operation is independent, so no overflow/stack/recursion issues.

### Solution

```python
from typing import List

def finalValueAfterOperations(operations: List[str]) -> int:
    # Start with x = 0
    x = 0
    # Go through every operation string
    for op in operations:
        # If the middle character is '+', increment x
        if op[1] == '+':
            x += 1
        # Otherwise, it must be a '-', so decrement x
        else:
            x -= 1
    return x
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of operations. We process each operation exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). Only a constant amount of extra space is used (for the integer x).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle if the operations are not guaranteed to be valid (i.e., could include other strings)?
  *Hint: Add an input validation step and handle unexpected strings appropriately.*

- What if each operation could increment or decrement by values other than 1 (e.g., "++2X", "--5X")?
  *Hint: Parse the number from the operation string and adjust x by that value.*

- Can you write a one-liner solution for languages that support functional constructs (e.g., Python, JavaScript)?
  *Hint: Use sum and list comprehension with conditionals.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic **simulation** and simple string-checking task; you process the instructions linearly and maintain a running total. The code demonstrates a pattern useful for similar instruction interpretation problems, especially where parsing and simulating a simple machine or state is required. This is common in basic interpreters, processor simulation, or beginner-level coding tasks.
