### Leetcode 3630 (Hard): Partition Array for Maximum XOR and AND [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-for-maximum-xor-and-and)

### Description  
Given an array of integers, partition it into three groups: A, B, and C (all possibly empty, their union forms the original array).  
- The goal: **maximize** XOR(A) + AND(B) + XOR(C) where:
  - XOR(A) is the xor of all numbers in A (0 if A is empty)
  - AND(B) is the and of all numbers in B (0 if B is empty)
  - XOR(C) is the xor of all numbers in C (0 if C is empty)
You can freely partition the elements as you wish.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3]`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation: One way is A = [1], B = [2], C = [3]. XOR(A) = 1, AND(B) = 2, XOR(C) = 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 (which is maximal).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1, 3, 2]`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation: A = [1, 2], B = [3], C = []. XOR(A)=1⊕2=3, AND(B)=3, XOR(C)=0, so total=3+3+0=6.  
But the max is also achieved by A=[1], B=[3], C=[2], 1+3+2=6. If tie, any is accepted.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [2,3,6,7]`  
Output: `15`  
*Explanation: A=[2,3], B=, C=, XOR(A)=2⊕3=1, AND(B)=6, XOR(C)=7, sum=1+6+7=14. Try other partitions, pick max sum. In this sample, one arrangement reaches 15.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force idea:**  
  - Try all possible ways to assign each element to A, B, or C. For each partition, compute the sum. Pick the maximum.
  - For n elements, there are 3ⁿ possible partitions (since every element chooses from 3 sets). This is too slow for even moderate n.

- **Can we optimize?**  
  - Notice:  
    - For fixed B, AND(B) is *fixed* (if B is empty, AND is 0).  
    - The rest (S = nums \ B) must be partitioned into A and C, both XORed.  
    - For each subset B, the optimal XOR(A)+XOR(C) is obtained by splitting S into two subsets.  
    - Finding maximal XOR(A)+XOR(C) for S can be done with cryptographic/XOR-basis tricks.

- **Optimization trade-off:**  
  - For each subset B (2ⁿ possibilities), compute AND(B) and then solve a XOR splitting problem on the rest.  
  - For moderate n (say n ≤ 16-18), this is feasible with clever use of bitmask, XOR-basis, etc.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty array (`[]`) ⇒ output is 0 (by definition, all ops on empty set = 0)
- Array of all equal elements (e.g. `[1,1,1,1]`)
- All elements zero
- Only one element (e.g. `[4]`)
- Large values, large n (check efficiency)

### Solution

```python
def partitionArrayForMaximumXORAndAND(nums):
    # n is the number of elements
    n = len(nums)
    max_total = 0

    # Precompute all AND(B) for all subsets B (possible B = all 0..2ⁿ-1)
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        and_b = -1  # -1 so that for first element AND works
        s = []               # S = nums \ B (rest)
        for i in range(n):
            if (mask >> i) & 1:
                if and_b == -1:
                    and_b = nums[i]
                else:
                    and_b &= nums[i]
            else:
                s.append(nums[i])
        if and_b == -1:
            and_b = 0  # If B is empty, AND is 0

        # Now on S, need to split into A and C to maximize XOR(A) + XOR(C)
        # Trick: for all splits, max XOR(A) + XOR(C) = max_xor + (xor_s ^ max_xor)
        # Use XOR basis to find best possible XOR(A)
        xor_s = 0
        for x in s:
            xor_s ^= x

        # XOR basis construction
        basis = []
        for x in s:
            for b in basis:
                x = min(x, x ^ b)
            if x:
                basis.append(x)

        # Now, try all subset XORs using basis, keep max (standard xor basis usage)
        max_xor = 0
        opts = [0]
        for x in basis:
            new_opts = []
            for v in opts:
                new_opts.append(v)
                new_opts.append(v ^ x)
            opts = list(set(new_opts))
        for a_x in opts:
            c_x = xor_s ^ a_x
            max_xor = max(max_xor, a_x + c_x)
        max_total = max(max_total, and_b + max_xor)

    return max_total
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(2ⁿ × 2ᵈ), where n is array length, d ≤ n is number of bits in basis.  
  - For each mask (2ⁿ choices for B), we build xor basis (up to n elements), and for each basis, enumerate 2ᵈ subset XORs.
  - For n ≤ 16, this is practical. For larger n, use further optimizations (branch-and-bound, etc.).

- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for current partition/basis. Optionally O(2ⁿ) if caching. The `opts` list may be up to 2ⁿ for very degenerate input but usually much less.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if n is up to 20 or more? Can you optimize further?
  *Hint: Try using meet-in-the-middle or pruning subsets.*

- Can you generalize if partitioning into k groups, not 3?
  *Hint: How would the formula and approach adapt?*

- What if you wanted to minimize the result instead?
  *Hint: Consider bases and bit tricks for minimization, not maximization.*

### Summary
This problem uses **bitmask DP**, **XOR basis**, and exhaustive subset enumeration, a combo frequently found in advanced partition/bitmanipulation challenges.  
The key trick is *reducing* the partition problem to fixed points (try all B) and splitting the rest optimally with XOR basis—a powerful tool in hard bitwise or partitioning problems.  
This pattern appears in partition, xor-sum, and various subset-split combinatorial tasks.  
Understanding subset enumeration with masks and xor-basis greatly expands toolbox for "divide into groups for maximization" problems.
