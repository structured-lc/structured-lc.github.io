### Leetcode 1815 (Hard): Maximum Number of Groups Getting Fresh Donuts [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-groups-getting-fresh-donuts)

### Description  
Given a batchSize and an array groups, where groups[i] is the size of the iᵗʰ group of customers coming to a donut shop, your goal is to maximize the number of "happy" groups.  
- The shop bakes donuts in batches of batchSize.
- Each group can be rearranged in any order.
- A group is happy if, after serving it, there are no leftover donuts from the previous group (i.e., they get "fresh" donuts, i.e., the remaining donuts from prior batches is 0).
Return the maximum number of happy groups you can achieve after optimally rearranging groups.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `batchSize = 3, groups = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`  
Output: `4`  
Explanation: Arrange as [6,2,4,5,1,3]. Groups with group size divisible by batchSize (like 3 and 6) are always happy. By grouping wisely, you can make 4 groups happy in total.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `batchSize = 4, groups = [1,3,2,5,2,2,1,6]`  
Output: `4`  
Explanation: By rearranging, you can maximize the number of groups that get fresh donuts.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `batchSize = 2, groups = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]`  
Output: `5`  
Explanation: All groups with even group size are happy. For odd ones, pair them efficiently.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force idea**: Try every possible order of groups. For each, compute number of happy groups by tracking donut leftovers after each group.  
  - **Problem**: Too slow (groups may have up to 30 elements — factorial complexity).
- **Observation**: Only the *remainder* when group size is divided by batchSize actually matters for leftovers.
- Count groups that are already happy (size % batchSize == 0).  
- For others, count number of groups per possible remainder (from 1 to batchSize-1).  
- **Key**: The only thing passed from one group to the next is the leftover donuts (the running sum of group sizes % batchSize).  
- This suggests "state compression" — we only need to know, at each point, the counts of each possible remainder left to arrange, and the current leftover.  
- Use DP + memoization:
  - DP(state, leftover): state is a tuple (or number) encoding remaining counts for each remainder, plus current leftover.
  - For each possible next remainder with remaining groups, try putting that one next. Calculate new leftover, recurse, and maximize happy groups (add 1 if leftovers==0 for that group).
  - Memoize each state to avoid recomputation.
- **Trade-off**: State space is manageable since batchSize ≤ 9 and  # groups ≤ 30.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All group sizes divisible by batchSize (all happy).
- Only one group.
- batchSize = 1 (everyone always happy).
- Large group numbers (need to handle modulo correctly).
- No group can be rearranged so there will be leftovers each time.

### Solution

```python
def maxHappyGroups(batchSize, groups):
    from collections import Counter
    from functools import lru_cache

    # Count happy groups right away (group size % batchSize == 0)
    happy = 0
    remain = [0] * batchSize

    for g in groups:
        r = g % batchSize
        if r == 0:
            happy += 1
        else:
            remain[r] += 1

    # State: tuple of counts for remain[1]..remain[batchSize-1]
    # We use only 1..B-1, as remain[0] already counted

    # To compress state, use tuple (r₁_count, r₂_count, ..., r_{B-1}_count)
    # Offset is the current leftover in the batch (0 for new batch, otherwise batchSize - (sum % batchSize))

    # To make tuple indexable, let's transfer to a tuple
    base = [1]
    for i in range(1, batchSize):
        base.append(base[-1] * (max(groups) + 1))  # max possible is len(groups) per bucket

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def dfs(state, leftover):
        # state: tuple of counts for each remainder bucket, leftover: amount carried over
        # Try every possible next group (with nonzero count)
        best = 0
        state_list = list(state)

        for r in range(1, batchSize):
            if state_list[r-1] == 0:
                continue

            # Use this remainder group next
            state_list[r-1] -= 1
            next_leftover = (leftover + r) % batchSize

            # Current group is happy if there's no leftover right now
            add_happy = 1 if leftover == 0 else 0
            best = max(best, add_happy + dfs(tuple(state_list), next_leftover))

            state_list[r-1] += 1  # backtrack

        return best

    state = tuple(remain[1:])  # omit remain[0]
    return happy + dfs(state, 0)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O((groups.length)^(batchSize-1)), since the state is the tuple of counts for each remainder (up to batchSize-1 buckets), which is quite manageable since batchSize ≤ 9 and len(groups) ≤ 30.  
- **Space Complexity:** O((groups.length)^(batchSize-1)) for memoization storage and recursion stack.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if batchSize could be as large as 100?
  *Hint: How would you represent the state efficiently, or could you use bitmask DP?*

- How would you handle the case if the groups cannot be rearranged (fixed order)?
  *Hint: The problem becomes linear; can you use simple prefix sums or a greedy approach?*

- Can you output the actual arrangement of groups to achieve the maximum?
  *Hint: Backtrack from your DP to reconstruct one of the optimal orders.*

### Summary
This problem uses **state compression DP and memoization**, focusing on the remainders of group sizes modulo batchSize to represent all possible states. Its core is modeling the problem via the counts of remainder buckets and recursively simulating the best next step.  
This dynamic programming pattern (state compression + memoization) is common in problems with combinatorial arrangements and group dependencies (such as coin change with limited coins, or job scheduling with dependent batches).


### Flashcard
Use DP with memoization on frequency counts of each remainder (1 to batchSize−1); try all orderings recursively, tracking leftover donuts.
