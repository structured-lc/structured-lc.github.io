### Leetcode 3693 (Medium): Climbing Stairs II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs-ii)

### Description  
You are climbing a staircase with \( n+1 \) steps, numbered from \( 0 \) to \( n \).  
You're given a 1-indexed integer array **costs** of length \( n \), where `costs[i]` is the cost to stand on step \( i \) (\( 1 \leq i \leq n \)).  
You start at **step 0** (which has no cost).  
From step \( i \), you can jump to step \( i+1 \), \( i+2 \), or \( i+3 \) (if within bounds).  
When jumping from \( i \) to \( j \):  
- You pay the cost at **step \( j \)** _plus_ a penalty of \( (j-i)^2 \) (the square of the jump distance).  
The goal is to **reach step \( n \)** with the minimum possible total cost.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `costs = [1,2,3]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: Steps are 0 → 1 → 3.  
Jump from 0→1: cost=1 + 1² = 2.  
Jump from 1→3: cost=3 + 2² = 4.  
Total cost: 2 + 4 = 6.  
But a better way: 0→2→3: cost=2 + 2² = 6, then 3: cost=3 + 1² = 4.  
But optimal way: 0→1→2→3: cost=1+1 + 2+1 + 3+1 = 9.  
Actually, minimum is 2 (0→1) + 5 (1→2) + 4 (2→3) = 11.  
[Let's clarify with a properly explained example:]  
Best way: 0→1 (cost=1+1=2), 1→3 (cost=3+2²=7). Total=2+7=9.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `costs = [10,15,20,5]`  
Output: `12`  
*Explanation: Steps 0→3→4.  
Jump from 0→3: cost=5+3²=14.  
Jump from 3→4: cost=0+1²=1.  
Total cost: 14+1=15.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `costs = [4,3,2,1]`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation: Steps 0→2→4.  
Jump from 0→2: cost=2+2²=6.  
Jump from 2→4: cost=1+2²=5.  
Total cost: 6+5=11.  
Try other paths for a lower cost.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- Start by thinking recursively: from each step, try jumps of +1, +2, or +3.
- For each destination step, add the cost of standing there plus the penalty for the jump distance.
- The brute-force solution explores all paths, but this leads to exponential time.
- The cost to reach step \( i \): minimum of cost to reach previous steps plus cost & penalty for jumping.
- Use **DP**: let `dp[i]` be the minimum cost to reach step \( i \).
- Transition:  
  For step i,  
    dp[i] = min(
      dp[i-1] + costs[i-1] + 1² (if i-1 ≥ 0),
      dp[i-2] + costs[i-2] + 2² (if i-2 ≥ 0),
      dp[i-3] + costs[i-3] + 3² (if i-3 ≥ 0)
    )
- Optimize with bottom-up DP for speed and space.

### Corner cases to consider  
- costs is empty: n = 0 (only step 0; cost = 0)  
- Only one step: costs = [x] (just one jump needed)  
- Large cost at certain steps (should avoid costly steps via longer jumps if penalty less)  
- Negative costs - can they occur? (Generally, cost assumed non-negative, but code should be robust.)  
- Minimum n (just 1 or 2 steps)

### Solution

```python
def minCostClimbingStairsII(costs):
    n = len(costs)
    # dp[i] will store the min cost to reach step i (0-indexed, step '0' has cost 0 and is a starting point)
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Starting at step 0 (no cost)

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # From step i-1 to i
        if i - 1 >= 0:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-1] + costs[i-1] + 1*1)
        # From step i-2 to i (if possible)
        if i - 2 >= 0:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-2] + costs[i-2] + 2*2)
        # From step i-3 to i (if possible)
        if i - 3 >= 0:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-3] + costs[i-3] + 3*3)
    return dp[n]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(n) — We fill a dp array of size n+1; for each position, we check up to 3 previous states.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(n) — For the dp array of size n+1.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if there are up to k jumps allowed instead of just 3?  
  *Hint: Make the inner loop up to k and generalize penalty as (j-i)².*

- Can you reconstruct the path taken to achieve the minimum cost?  
  *Hint: Track parent steps during DP computation.*

- Can you make it O(1) space?  
  *Hint: Only last 3 dp values are needed to compute each new state.*

### Summary  
This problem is a **dynamic programming** variant of classic climbing stairs, with added cost and penalty calculations.  
It uses a standard DP pattern with each `dp[i]` considering only a fixed number of previous states — like house robber, Fibonacci, or min-cost stair problems.  
This pattern applies to many pathfinding problems with local transitions and penalties.  
Optimizations include reducing space to O(1) if only last few states needed and reconstructing solution paths if required.
