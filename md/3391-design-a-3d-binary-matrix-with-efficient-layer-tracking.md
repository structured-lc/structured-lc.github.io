### Leetcode 3391 (Medium): Design a 3D Binary Matrix with Efficient Layer Tracking [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-a-3d-binary-matrix-with-efficient-layer-tracking)

### Description  
You are asked to design a special 3D matrix for efficient layer-wise queries. The matrix is n × n × n and contains only 0s and 1s.  
Implement the `Matrix3D` class with these operations:
- `Matrix3D(int n)`: initializes a 3D binary matrix of all 0s.
- `setCell(x, y, z)`: sets `matrix[x][y][z]` = 1.
- `unsetCell(x, y, z)`: sets `matrix[x][y][z]` = 0.
- `largestMatrix()`: Returns the `x` index with the most 1s in layer `matrix[x]`. If there are ties, return the largest such `x`.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `["Matrix3D", "setCell", "largestMatrix", "setCell", "largestMatrix", "setCell", "largestMatrix"]`,  
       `[[3], [0,0,0], [], [1,1,2], [], [0,0,1], []]`  
Output: `[null, null, 0, null, 1, null, 0]`  
Explanation:  
- Matrix3D(3): initializes a 3×3×3 empty matrix.
- setCell(0,0,0): sets matrix=1.
- largestMatrix(): only layer 0 has a 1, returns 0.
- setCell(1,1,2): sets matrix[1][1][2]=1.
- largestMatrix(): only one 1 each in layer 0 and 1, so returns the largest: 1.
- setCell(0,0,1): layer 0 has 2 ones, layer 1 has 1 → returns 0.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `["Matrix3D", "setCell", "setCell", "largestMatrix"]`,  
       `[[2], [0,0,0], [1,1,1], []]`  
Output: `[null, null, null, 1]`  
Explanation:  
After two `setCell`, both layer 0 and 1 have 1 one each. `largestMatrix()` returns 1.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `["Matrix3D", "largestMatrix"]`,  
       `[[5], []]`  
Output: `[null, 4]`  
Explanation:  
Matrix is empty, so all layers have 0 ones. Returns largest possible index: 4 (since layers are 0-indexed).

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
Start with brute force:
- For each operation, keep a 3D list. For `largestMatrix`, count 1s in each layer and choose the required index.
    - Problem: `largestMatrix` is O(n²) per call, which is too slow (n is up to 10⁴).

Optimized:
- Maintain an array `layerCnt[x]` = count of ones in xᵗʰ layer (matrix[x]).
- On `setCell` and `unsetCell`, keep a set/dictionary for each (x, y, z) that is set, preventing double counting.
- Need to track the largest `x` with the maximal ones:
    - Use a balanced BST or SortedDict to map count ↔ set of x to efficiently retrieve the largest such x on update or query.
    - Each operation is then O(log n).

Chose this because:
- Direct 3D array is space and time prohibitive.
- Layer count array + balanced structure for (count, set of x) gives quick updates and queries.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Multiple (x, y, z) set/unset cycles.
- Different layers having the same max count.
- All-zeros case: should return the largest valid index.
- Setting a cell that's already set/clearing already clear cell.
- Large n (performance).

### Solution

```python
class Matrix3D:
    def __init__(self, n):
        # Initialize dimensions
        self.n = n
        # Track set cells to prevent recounting
        self.cells = set()
        # Count of 1s in each x-layer
        self.layer_cnt = [0] * n
        # Map: count of ones → set of layers with that count
        from collections import defaultdict
        self.count2layer = defaultdict(set)
        for i in range(n):
            self.count2layer[0].add(i)
        self.max_count = 0

    def setCell(self, x, y, z):
        key = (x, y, z)
        if key in self.cells:
            return
        self.cells.add(key)
        prev = self.layer_cnt[x]
        self.layer_cnt[x] += 1
        self.count2layer[prev].remove(x)
        if not self.count2layer[prev]:
            del self.count2layer[prev]
        self.count2layer[prev + 1].add(x)
        self.max_count = max(self.max_count, prev + 1)

    def unsetCell(self, x, y, z):
        key = (x, y, z)
        if key not in self.cells:
            return
        self.cells.remove(key)
        prev = self.layer_cnt[x]
        self.layer_cnt[x] -= 1
        self.count2layer[prev].remove(x)
        if not self.count2layer[prev]:
            del self.count2layer[prev]
        self.count2layer[prev - 1].add(x)
        if self.max_count == prev and not self.count2layer.get(prev):
            # Update max_count if needed
            self.max_count = max(self.count2layer.keys(), default=0)

    def largestMatrix(self):
        # Get largest x from max_count layer set
        return max(self.count2layer[self.max_count])
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**
    - `setCell`/`unsetCell`: O(log n), due to set/dictionary operations and maintaining counts.
    - `largestMatrix`: O(1) to get the largest x from a set.
- **Space Complexity:**
    - O(n + K), n for layer counts and dict, plus K for number of set cells.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle very large n where 3D allocation is impossible?  
  *Hint: Use sets/dictionaries to sparsely represent only set entries, never materialize a full 3D array.*

- How to return not just the largest, but all `x` with the max count of 1s, sorted?  
  *Hint: Instead of max, take the whole set for `max_count`, and sort if needed.*

- What if you need to repeatedly increase all counts in a range of x-layers?  
  *Hint: Use a segment tree or lazy propagation approach for such range updates.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic example of data structure design for efficient layer-wise statistics and query.  
The main pattern is *frequency counting with on-the-fly maximum tracking*, which occurs in problems involving histogram queries and efficiently tracking maxima/minima in updated sets.  
You can apply this approach in memory-efficient 3D/2D tracking and maximum-frequency set extraction in other interview contexts.
