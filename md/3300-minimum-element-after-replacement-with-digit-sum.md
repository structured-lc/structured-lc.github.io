### Leetcode 3300 (Easy): Minimum Element After Replacement With Digit Sum [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-element-after-replacement-with-digit-sum)

### Description  
Given an integer array **nums**, for each element, replace it with the sum of its digits. Then, return the *minimum* element from the modified array.  
You do not modify the original array in-place; just find the answer as if this replacement has occurred.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [10,12,13,14]`,  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: After replacing each element with sum of its digits: [1,3,4,5]. The minimum is 1.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`,  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: After replacement: [1,2,3,4]. The minimum is 1.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [999,19,199]`,  
Output: `10`  
*Explanation: Digit sums: [27,10,19]. The minimum is 10.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The brute-force idea is to iterate through each element, compute its digit sum, and then take the minimum of these sums.
- Calculating the digit sum for a number can be done by repeatedly taking `num % 10` and integer dividing by 10.
- As the input size `len(nums)` is at most 100 and each number is at most 10⁴, both the number of elements and the digit sums are small—so a brute-force solution is acceptable and efficient.
- Optimization is unnecessary since each operation runs in O(1) per element, but we could write the digit sum logic as a helper for clarity and early returns if the sum is 1.
- No trade-off here: optimality and simplicity align.

### Corner cases to consider  
- An array of length 1 (single integer).
- Numbers that are all single digits (digit sum equals the number itself).
- Numbers that are all the same.
- Very large numbers like 10⁴ (but still relatively small for digit sum).
- Numbers with zeros (like 100, 1000).

### Solution

```python
def min_element_after_digit_sum(nums):
    # Helper to calculate digit sum of a number
    def digit_sum(n):
        total = 0
        while n > 0:
            total += n % 10
            n //= 10
        return total

    min_sum = float('inf')
    for num in nums:
        dsum = digit_sum(num)
        if dsum < min_sum:
            min_sum = dsum
    return min_sum
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(N × k), where N is the length of nums and k is the max number of digits (at most 5 since max num is 10⁴). Effectively O(N).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space (ignoring input), as only a few variables are used.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the array was too large to fit in memory?
  *Hint: Consider a streaming/dynamic approach to maintain the minimum digit sum seen so far.*

- What if each replaced value had to be stored in place, not just the minimum?
  *Hint: Consider updating the input in-place, or creating a new array for the transformed numbers.*

- What if we wanted the *second* smallest element after replacement?
  *Hint: Keep both the smallest and the second smallest digit sums as you process the array.*

### Summary
This is a classic *array and digit manipulation* problem where a mapping operation (digit sum) is followed by a minimum-finding. The pattern appears frequently in digit/number transformation problems. The approach—processing each element individually, computing something simple (digit sum), and aggregating (minimum)—is a foundation for more complex data streaming and in-place transformation problems.
