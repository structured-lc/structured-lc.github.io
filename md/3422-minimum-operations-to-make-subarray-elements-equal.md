### Leetcode 3422 (Medium): Minimum Operations to Make Subarray Elements Equal [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-subarray-elements-equal)

### Description  
Given an integer array **nums** and an integer **k**, you can repeatedly increase or decrease any element of **nums** by 1 (each operation changes one value by 1). Your goal is to ensure that **at least one subarray of length k** in **nums** has all its values equal (the value can be any integer). Return the **minimum number of operations** needed.

In other words:  
You want to select any length-k window in **nums**, and with the fewest total `+1` or `-1` steps (across all the elements in the window), change the window so all k values are identical.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [4, -3, 2, 1, -4, 6]`, `k = 3`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation:  
- Increase nums[1] (-3) by 4 → [4,1,2,1,-4,6] (4 operations).  
- Decrease nums[2] (2) by 1 → [4,1,1,1,-4,6] (1 operation).  
Now, subarray [1,1,1] of size 3 is all equal. Minimal operations = 5.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [-2, -2, 3, 1, 4]`, `k = 2`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation:  
The subarray [-2, -2] already has both values equal, so no moves are needed.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [7, 3, 3, 5, 7, 1]`, `k = 4`  
Output: `7`  
*Explanation:  
- Choose the window [3,3,5,7].  
- Make all elements 5 (arbitrary, but median minimizes total moves):  
  - |3-5| + |3-5| + |5-5| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 6  
- Try other windows, minimal possible operations is 7 for this input.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

- **Brute-force approach:**
  - Try every window of size k in **nums**.
  - For each window, compute the cost to make all the values equal (try all possible target values?).
  - For each target, sum up abs(window[i] - target) for i=0..k-1.
  - Since the window is length k (and at most nums.length = 10⁵), and for each window, checking all possible targets is too slow.

- **Optimization:**
  - The minimum total operations to make all elements equal to the same value (any value) is minimized when we set them all to the **median** of the window. (This is a well-known property: sum of absolute differences is minimized at the median.)
  - So, for each window of size k, find the median, compute total cost as sum(|x - median| for all x in window).
  - Use a sliding window to move through all k-length windows.
  - For efficiency: Can maintain a balanced BST or two heaps to dynamically track the median as window slides, and efficiently update total costs.

- **Why choose this approach:**  
  - Brute-force is O(nk log k), too slow for large arrays.  
  - Sliding window with balanced structure (multiset/heap) gives O(n log k), which is efficient enough for the constraints.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All elements are already equal in some subarray.
- **k = len(nums):** entire array is the only possible subarray.
- Negative and positive numbers.
- Duplicate numbers or all numbers different.
- Only one element in an eligible subarray.
- Multiple windows yield the same minimum result.

### Solution

```python
import bisect

def min_operations(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    if k == 1:
        return 0  # Any single element is already "equal"

    # Initialize the first window and keep it sorted
    window = sorted(nums[:k])
    # Compute initial cost: set all to median of window
    def median_cost(arr):
        m = arr[len(arr)//2]
        return sum(abs(x - m) for x in arr)
    min_cost = median_cost(window)

    # Sliding window: remove leftmost, add new rightmost
    for i in range(k, n):
        # Remove nums[i - k] from window
        out_val = nums[i - k]
        idx = bisect.bisect_left(window, out_val)
        window.pop(idx)
        # Insert nums[i] into window
        in_val = nums[i]
        bisect.insort(window, in_val)
        # Compute new cost
        cost = median_cost(window)
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)

    return min_cost
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n \* log k)  
  - Each window slide does one remove + one insert (both log k using bisect.insort/bisect_left),
    and median + abs-diff sum is O(k) per window (for small k — if k large, optimize further).
- **Space Complexity:** O(k)  
  - The window stores k elements, plus minimal extra pointers.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you wanted to make **at least m subarrays** (or all subarrays) of length k have their elements equal?
  *Hint: Consider overlap and combinatorial subarray selection.*

- How would you modify the approach if instead of “equal”, you wanted all subarray elements to be within some delta d of each other?
  *Hint: Use sliding window with max-min constraints.*

- Can you optimize memory or runtime further if k is very small or very large (e.g., k = 2 or k = n-1)?
  *Hint: Tailor data structures to edge sizes for faster performance.*

### Summary
We use the **sliding window** pattern with a balanced window data structure (here, a sorted list with binary search) to efficiently keep track of the median and compute total change costs as the window moves. This is a classic "minimize absolute difference sum" technique, where the **median** is always optimal. This coding pattern is broadly applicable to problems involving windowed medians, order statistics in windows, and other sliding cost aggregations.
