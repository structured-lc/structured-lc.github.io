### Leetcode 553 (Medium): Optimal Division [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-division)

### Description  
Given an array of **positive integers** `nums`, construct a division expression using all the numbers **exactly once**, where you may use parentheses any way you want. Your goal is to write the division expression as a string such that when evaluated (left to right, as usual), it produces the **maximum possible value**. The division is floating-point, and it's left-associative. Parentheses can be added anywhere to alter the default precedence, but the expression should not have any redundant parentheses. Return the optimal string representation.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1000,100,10,2]`  
Output: `"1000/(100/10/2)"`  
*Explanation: 1000 divided by (100 ÷ 10 ÷ 2) = 1000 ÷ (100 ÷ 10 ÷ 2) = 1000 ÷ (100 ÷ 20) = 1000 ÷ 5 = 200. This is larger than any other grouping.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [2,3,4]`  
Output: `"2/(3/4)"`  
*Explanation: Maximum value: 2 ÷ (3 ÷ 4) = 2 ÷ 0.75 = 2.666... Any other grouping is smaller.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [2,3]`  
Output: `"2/3"`  
*Explanation: Only one way to place division, so just return the division as-is.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
To maximize the result, I want the **first number to be as big as possible** and the denominator—the result of dividing all other numbers—as small as possible.

- If there's **only two numbers**, just return `nums/nums[1]`.
- If there are **three or more numbers**, the way to minimize the denominator is to make it a chain of divisions—i.e., the denominator is `nums[1]/nums[2]/.../nums[n-1]`. So, mathematically, place parentheses like: `nums/(nums[1]/nums[2]/.../nums[n-1])`.

The intuition is: by grouping all divisors in the denominator, their result gets as small as possible (since dividing by a small number yields a large quotient), and that makes the overall division as large as we can get.

I don't need to consider deeply nested or multiple different parenthesis placements, as this form always maximizes the result.

### Corner cases to consider  
- One element: Not possible (per constraints; minimum 2 elements).
- Two elements: No parentheses.
- Three or more elements: One set of parentheses around everything except the first number.
- All numbers are the same: Should still work.
- Large numbers to check for any string formatting issues.

### Solution

```python
def optimalDivision(nums):
    # If there's only one or two numbers, no parentheses needed.
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return str(nums[0])
    if len(nums) == 2:
        return str(nums[0]) + '/' + str(nums[1])
    # For three or more, enclose all but the first in parentheses
    middle = '/'.join(str(num) for num in nums[1:])
    return '{}'/({})'.format(nums[0], middle)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of nums. We convert each element to string and join them.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), needed for the output string and internal string lists.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle negative values or zeros in the input?
  *Hint: Think about division by zero, or if negatives can change the maximization logic.*

- How would you generate the **minimum possible division** result?
  *Hint: Consider grouping numerator or denominator; does the logic mirror the maximum case?*

- What if the input list is very long (thousands of numbers)? Can you optimize string building further?
  *Hint: Think in terms of Python join efficiency, or minimizing intermediate memory allocations.*

### Summary  
This approach relies on **greedy grouping**: maximize the numerator, minimize the denominator. It's a classic example of searching for an optimal parenthesization in arithmetic expressions, but the division operation’s non-associativity leads to a direct greedy solution rather than exhaustive search or dynamic programming. The string operations (join, format) are common patterns, especially for constructing arithmetic expressions from lists. This reasoning is applicable to other optimal parenthesization problems, particularly with non-commutative and non-associative operators.
