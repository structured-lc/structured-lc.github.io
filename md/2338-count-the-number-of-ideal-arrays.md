### Leetcode 2338 (Hard): Count the Number of Ideal Arrays [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-ideal-arrays)

### Description  
You are given two integers, **n** and **maxValue**. Find how many distinct integer arrays **arr** of length **n** exist such that:
- For all **0 ≤ i < n**, 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ maxValue.
- For all **1 ≤ i < n**, arr[i] is divisible by arr[i-1].
Return the result modulo 10⁹ + 7.

An "ideal" array is one where each subsequent element is divisible by the previous one, and all elements are between 1 and maxValue, inclusive.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 2, maxValue = 5`  
Output: `10`  
Explanation: The possible arrays are:  
[1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [1,5], [2,2], [2,4], [3,3], [4,4], [5,5].

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 5, maxValue = 3`  
Output: `11`  
Explanation: The possible arrays are:  
Arrays starting with 1 (9 arrays — from [1,1,1,1,1] up to [1,3,3,3,3]),  
Arrays starting with 2 ([2,2,2,2,2]),  
Arrays starting with 3 ([3,3,3,3,3]).

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 3, maxValue = 2`  
Output: `4`  
Explanation: The possible arrays are:  
[1,1,1], [1,1,2], [1,2,2], [2,2,2]

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
At first glance, brute-force would generate all arrays of length n of values [1,maxValue] and check each for the division property, but this is computationally infeasible because maxValueⁿ gets huge even for moderate n and maxValue.

Instead, reverse the problem using dynamic programming and combinatorics:
- Fix the last element in the array, say x.
- The previous element must be a divisor of x.
- If we construct all possible **multiplicative chains** from 1 to x (where each is a divisor of the next), the number of sequences for each possible chain can be counted combinatorially:
  - The problem reduces to: For all possible sequences of length ≤ n, where each element divides the next (and each ≤ maxValue), count how many such extension to length n can be constructed for every possible starting number.

But building each chain explicitly is too slow. Instead:
- The number of ways to allocate k "jumps" (multiplicative increases; i.e., to go from 1 to x in k steps via multipliers) among n-1 splits can be represented as combinations (stars and bars): C(n-1, k).
- For every final value x, count how many chains of multiplications by divisors leads to x of length k or less. For each, multiply by C(n-1, k), because positions of those jumps can be rearranged.

So, for each number x in [1, maxValue]:
- Find all chains of multipliers that lead to x (count groupings via its prime factors),
- For each, add C(n-1, k) to the answer.

This requires efficient computation of combinations, prime factorizations, and dynamic programming for divisor chain counts.

### Corner cases to consider  
- n = 1: Every value 1 ≤ x ≤ maxValue is valid, so answer = maxValue.
- maxValue = 1: Only [1,1,1,...] is possible, so answer = 1.
- Large n: Efficient combinatorics up to n ≈ 10⁴ are required.
- All values same: (e.g., [2,2,2,...]) must be included.

### Solution

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def count_ideal_arrays(n, maxValue):
    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials for combinations up to n+log2(maxValue)
    NMAX = n + 14   # can be bounded to n + log2(maxValue)
    factorial = [1] * (NMAX + 1)
    inv = [1] * (NMAX + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, NMAX + 1):
        factorial[i] = factorial[i-1] * i % MOD

    # fast inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem
    inv[NMAX] = pow(factorial[NMAX], MOD-2, MOD)
    for i in range(NMAX-1, -1, -1):
        inv[i] = inv[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD
    
    def comb(a, b):
        if b < 0 or b > a:
            return 0
        return factorial[a] * inv[b] % MOD * inv[a-b] % MOD

    # For each value x up to maxValue, count ways to write as product of divisors, then "distribute" across positions
    # dp[x][k]: number of ways x can be reached in k steps (multiplying by divisors at each step)
    # For memory, we use sieve to precompute for each x, its divisors

    import collections
    res = 0
    max_k = 14  # log2(10^4) ≈ 14, depth of chain

    # For every integer up to maxValue, count number of prime factors (with multiplicity), store in cnt_factors
    cnt_factors = [0] * (maxValue + 1)
    for x in range(2, maxValue+1):
        y = x
        for p in range(2, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            while y % p == 0:
                cnt_factors[x] += 1
                y //= p
        if y > 1 and y != x:
            cnt_factors[x] += 1

    # For every x, factoring out:
    # number of ways to pick k (with repetition) positions for prime factors distributed among n-1 slots = comb(n-1+k, k)
    spf = [0] * (maxValue + 1)  # smallest prime factor
    for i in range(2, maxValue + 1):
        if spf[i] == 0:
            for j in range(i, maxValue + 1, i):
                if spf[j] == 0:
                    spf[j] = i

    from collections import defaultdict

    # For every number, find how many prime factors for combinatoric assignment
    for value in range(1, maxValue+1):
        # Prime factorization of value
        factors = []
        x = value
        while x > 1:
            p = spf[x]
            cnt = 0
            while x % p == 0:
                x //= p
                cnt += 1
            factors.append(cnt)
        # For a sequence, distribute sum(factors) increments among n-1
        # Number of ways: for k additive events, C(n-1 + k, k)
        total_ways = 1
        k = 0
        for cnt in factors:
            total_ways = total_ways * comb(n - 1 + cnt, cnt) % MOD
            k += cnt
        res = (res + total_ways) % MOD

    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(maxValue × log(maxValue) + n + maxValue × log(maxValue))  
  - Prime sieve for factors up to maxValue is O(maxValue × log log maxValue).
  - For each value in 1..maxValue, factorization is log(maxValue) on average.
  - For each value, do up to 14 combination computations (since number of prime factors ≤ log₂(maxValue)).
- **Space Complexity:** O(maxValue + n)  
  - Storage for factorials and their inverses up to n+14.
  - Storage for spf (smallest prime factor) and a few counters.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you change the approach if the division constraint required strict divisibility by a fixed factor?  
  *Hint: Use geometric progression and count such subsequences.*

- Can you solve for large n and large maxValue (e.g., both up to 10⁸)?  
  *Hint: Use Mobius function and inclusion-exclusion to group by GCD rather than enumerate all numbers individually.*

- What would change if the array could be non-integer, or if floating point values were allowed?  
  *Hint: The combinatorial structure would break, and you’d need a different recurrence or approach.*

### Summary
This problem is a combination of **dynamic programming, combinatorics, number theory, and prime factorization**. The key insight is to count how many ways sequences of n positions can be filled such that each next value is a multiple of the previous, by distributing increments among prime factors with stars-and-bars. The core coding pattern is **counting unordered multisets, combinatorial distribution, and using precomputed factorials**—ideas that frequently appear in integer partitioning, lattice path, and number-theoretical combinatorics problems.
