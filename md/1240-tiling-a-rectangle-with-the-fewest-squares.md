### Leetcode 1240 (Hard): Tiling a Rectangle with the Fewest Squares [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/tiling-a-rectangle-with-the-fewest-squares)

### Description  
Given a rectangle of size n × m, you need to tile the entire rectangle using integer-sided squares (sizes 1×1, 2×2, ..., up to min(n, m)×min(n, m)), with **the fewest possible number of tiles**. No overlaps or gaps are allowed. 

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 2, m = 3`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: You can cover it with one 2×2 square (covering the bottom left) and two 1×1 squares for the top right corners.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 5, m = 8`  
Output: `5`  
*Explanation: The minimal tiling uses 5 squares of various sizes (specific placements can be constructed).* 

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 11, m = 13`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation: The optimal arrangement is 6 squares (placement depends on dynamic programming choices).*  

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute force/Backtracking:** For any coordinate in the rectangle, try to fit the largest square possible, recursively fill the remaining area. This guarantees all configurations but is very slow due to overlapping subproblems and exponential time.
- **Optimization:** Since n, m ≤ 13, we can use dynamic programming (DP) to cache results and avoid recomputation for identical subrectangles. Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of squares needed for an i × j rectangle.
    - If either i = 0 or j = 0 → answer is 0.
    - If i = j → answer is 1 (the whole rectangle is a square).
    - For other cases, try placing squares of size k × k at the top-left, for all possible k ≤ min(i, j), and recursively tile the remaining pieces (need to consider all partitions).
- **Trade-off:** Brute-force (backtracking) is simple, but DP is essential for speed (memoization).

### Corner cases to consider  
- n or m is 0 (trivial case, no tiles needed)
- n = m (the rectangle is a square already)
- Very thin rectangles (like 1×n or n×1), where only 1×1 squares fit
- Most area is covered but a small region remains (need to try smaller tiles late in recursion)
- Minimal vs. greedy tiling differences (largest-first is not always optimal)

### Solution

```python
# Dynamic Programming approach, tailored for 1 <= n, m <= 13
# dp[i][j]: Minimum number of squares to tile i x j rectangle

def tilingRectangle(n, m):
    if n > m:
        n, m = m, n  # always ensure n <= m
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(m + 1):
            if i == 0 or j == 0:
                dp[i][j] = 0
            elif i == j:
                dp[i][j] = 1
            else:
                # try horizontal cuts
                for k in range(1, i // 2 + 1):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[k][j] + dp[i - k][j])
                # try vertical cuts
                for k in range(1, j // 2 + 1):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[i][j - k])
                # try placing larger squares and recursively solve the rest
                for k in range(1, min(i, j)):
                    for a in range(1, i - k + 1):
                        for b in range(1, j - k + 1):
                            # Place k × k square at (a, b)
                            res = (dp[a + k - 1][b - 1] +
                                   dp[i - (a + k - 1)][j - (b + k - 1)] +
                                   dp[a - 1][j - (b + k - 1)] +
                                   dp[i - (a + k - 1)][b - 1] + 1)
                            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], res)
    return dp[n][m]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n³ × m³) in the DP (since for each i, j, worst-case slicing is O(n × m)). Acceptable for 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 13.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n × m), for the DP array, manageable given the constraints.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if rectangle size n, m could go up to 1000?  
  *Hint: DP table becomes infeasible. Explore greedy, bounding, or mathematical approaches.*

- If squares with arbitrary (not integer) sides are allowed?  
  *Hint: Consider tiling theory and whether solution always exists or can be expressed in closed form.*

- What if squares must be of all the same size?  
  *Hint: It's simply ceiling division along each dimension; n×m filled with ⌈n/k⌉ × ⌈m/k⌉ tiles of size k×k.*

### Summary
The DP approach is critical for optimal rectangle tiling when dimensions are small. This solution fits the **DP on 2D state** pattern, often reapplicable to grid partitioning problems where substructure results can be cached. Techniques here are common for similar "tiling" or "partitioning" problems in combinatorics and dynamic programming.


### Flashcard
Use DP to cache minimum squares needed for each subrectangle; always place the largest possible square first.
