### Leetcode 3065 (Easy): Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-exceed-threshold-value-i)

### Description  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, you can repeatedly remove the smallest element in the array (one occurrence per operation). Your goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed so that *every* remaining element in the array is greater than or equal to `k`.  
In other words, how many elements less than `k` must be removed until all elements are at least `k`?

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [2,11,10,1,3]`, `k = 10`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Remove `2`, `1`, and `3` (all less than 10). Leftover elements `[11,10]` are all ≥ 10.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1,4,3,2,2,7]`, `k = 3`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Remove `1`, `2`, and another `2`. Remaining array is `[4,3,7]`, all elements ≥ 3.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [5,6,7]`, `k = 4`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: All elements are already ≥ 4, so no operations needed.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- The operation always removes the smallest element, and each operation gets rid of one instance of a number less than `k`.
- To make sure all numbers left are ≥ `k`, just remove every element < `k`.
- So, the minimum operations needed = count of elements strictly less than `k`.
- Brute-force: Could simulate removal, but that's unnecessary and inefficient.
- Optimal: Just loop through the array and count how many times `num < k`.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Array is empty (`nums = []`): Output = 0 (there’s nothing to remove).
- All elements ≥ `k`: Output = 0 (no operations needed).
- All elements < `k`: Output = `len(nums)` (have to remove everything).
- Array contains duplicates less than `k`.
- `k` is negative: No operations needed unless there are numbers less than this negative `k`.
- `k` very large (all numbers < `k`): Remove all.

### Solution

```python
def min_operations_to_exceed_threshold(nums, k):
    # Count the number of elements less than k
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num < k:
            count += 1
    return count
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), because we scan each element of the array exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a few variables for counting and no extra data structures besides the input.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if we wanted to remove elements to ensure *all* remaining numbers are *strictly greater* than `k`?  
  *Hint: Count elements `≤ k` rather than `< k`.*

- How would your answer change if you were allowed to remove any element (not just the smallest) in each operation?  
  *Hint: You could remove all smaller elements in any order, so the solution stays the same—remove all elements less than `k`.*

- How would you solve this if the input array were very large and streamed in chunks?  
  *Hint: Use a running counter and process each chunk one at a time, counting the numbers less than `k`.*

### Summary
This problem is a textbook example of counting with a single pass—a core array pattern. You traverse the list, count items with a simple condition, and output that count. Variations of this approach are common in filtering, partitioning, or streaming array problems. It’s a fundamental building block in algorithm interviews.
