### Leetcode 165 (Medium): Compare Version Numbers [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers)

### Description  
Given two version numbers, **version1** and **version2**, each represented as a string (such as "1.0.1" or "0.1"), compare them to determine which one is greater, or if they are equal. Each part of the version number (separated by `.`) is called a "revision". Compare revisions in left-to-right order as integers (ignoring leading zeros). If one version has fewer revisions, treat missing revisions as 0.  
Return:
- **1** if version1 > version2
- **-1** if version1 < version2
- **0** if version1 == version2

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation: After ignoring leading zeros, both versions become "1.1", so they are equal.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation: The missing revision in version1 is considered 0, so both compare as "1.0.0".

**Example 3:**  
Input: `version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"`  
Output: `-1`  
Explanation: Comparing revisions left-to-right, 0 < 1, so version1 is less than version2.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

First, both version strings need to be split using the dot `.` delimiter to get a list of revision numbers. Each revision should be compared as an integer, ignoring any leading zeros. The comparison proceeds from the leftmost revision to the right. If one version runs out of revisions, treat the missing revisions as 0 for comparison. If at any position the two revisions are unequal, return 1 or -1 accordingly. If all are equal, return 0.

**Brute-force** approach:  
- Split both strings by `.` into arrays.
- Convert each split part to integer and compare corresponding indices.  
- For different-length arrays, loop up to the longer one and treat missing parts as 0.

This approach has **O(max(M, N))** time complexity where M and N are the lengths of the versions.

**Optimizations**:  
- Instead of creating full arrays, use two pointers to process on-the-fly, parsing integers between dots one revision at a time.
- This avoids extra space and is ideal for long version strings.

Choosing the two-pointer/in-place parsing approach is memory efficient and handles arbitrary-length strings or very large revisions.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Extra trailing zeros (e.g., `"1.0.0"` vs `"1.0"`)
- Leading zeros in revisions (`"01.002"`)
- Different numbers of revisions (e.g., `"1.1"` vs `"1.1.1.0.0"`)
- Extremely large revision numbers (to ensure parsing as integer is robust)
- Both strings have only one revision
- Versions consisting solely of zeros (`"0.0.0"`, `"0"`)

### Solution

```python
def compareVersion(version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
    # Split both version strings by '.' to get list of revision numbers
    v1_parts = version1.split('.')
    v2_parts = version2.split('.')
    
    # Calculate the max length to compare all revisions, fill missing as 0
    max_len = max(len(v1_parts), len(v2_parts))
    
    for i in range(max_len):
        # Parse iᵗʰ revision, defaulting to 0 if current version is shorter
        num1 = int(v1_parts[i]) if i < len(v1_parts) else 0
        num2 = int(v2_parts[i]) if i < len(v2_parts) else 0
        
        if num1 > num2:
            return 1
        elif num1 < num2:
            return -1
    
    # All revisions are the same
    return 0
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the number of revisions in version1 and version2. Each revision is compared once, and split is O(len(s)).
- **Space Complexity:** O(m + n), needed to store split lists of both version strings. If using pointer and in-place parsing, can be done in O(1) extra space.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle arbitrarily large version strings, possibly streaming or processing very large inputs?
  *Hint: Consider processing characters directly without splitting the whole string.*

- If a version string could contain alphabetic characters (like "1.a.2"), how would you handle lexicographical comparisons?
  *Hint: Check if each revision is numeric or alphabetic, and define comparison rules.*

- What if you need to handle pre-release labels (e.g., "1.0.0-alpha", "1.0.0-beta")?
  *Hint: Define rules for ordering pre-release tags, often found in semantic versioning.*

### Summary
The key insight is breaking down and comparing each revision as an integer, handling missing revisions as 0. This problem leverages the **two-pointer** or **parallel iteration** pattern and robust input parsing. This pattern recurs in problems needing synchronized traversal of two sequences, such as merging sorted lists or comparing strings/arrays elementwise.
