### Leetcode 3635 (Medium): Earliest Finish Time for Land and Water Rides II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/earliest-finish-time-for-land-and-water-rides-ii)

### Description  
You are given two lists of rides: **land rides** and **water rides**. Each ride has an earliest start time and a duration. A tourist must experience exactly **one land ride** and **one water ride**, in *any order*. The tourist can start a ride at its opening time or any time after that. After finishing one ride, they go immediately to the other; if it is open, they can ride it immediately, or else they must wait until it opens. The goal: **find the earliest possible time the tourist can finish both rides**.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
landRides = [[2, 4], [6, 5]], waterRides = [[1, 3], [7, 2]]  
Output: `11`  
*Explanation:*
- Option 1: Take land ride 0 (start at 2, finish at 6), then take water ride 1 (can start at 7, after land ride ends, finishes at 9).
- Option 2: Take water ride 0 (start at 1, finish at 4), then land ride 1 (can start at 6, after water ride ends, finishes at 11).
- The minimum finish time overall is 9 (option 1), but for option 2 it is 11, and for option 1 it's 9. But let's check:  
   Land0 → Water1: end = max(2+4, 7) + 2 = max(6,7)+2=9  
   Water0 → Land1: end = max(1+3, 6)+5 = max(4,6)+5=11  
- So the earliest finish is `9`.

**Example 2:**  
Input:  
landRides = [[0, 2]], waterRides = [[10, 1]]  
Output: `11`  
*Explanation:*
- Must do land then water: land at 0–2, water can start at 10, so finish at 11.

**Example 3:**  
Input:  
landRides = [[3, 4], [8, 2]], waterRides = [[5, 5], [1, 3]]  
Output: `10`  
*Explanation:*  
- Water1 (1,3) → finishes at 4, land0 starts at 3, finish at max(4,3)+4=8  
   Water0 (5,5): can't do before land rides finish early, so only option is: land0(3,4)→ finish at 7, water0(5,5)→start at 7, finish at 12.  
- Try all combinations, pick minimum. The earliest possible is `8`.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force:** Try all possible pairs of (land ride, water ride), for both orders: land→water and water→land. For each, compute finish time.
    - For land→water:  
      - Start land at its earliest, it ends at start+duration. Then go to selected water ride: can start at max(water start time, when land finished), ends at that time + water duration.
    - For water→land: similar logic.
    - Track the minimum finish time over all combinations.
- **Optimization:** Since input sizes are moderate (else brute-force won't work), but if constraints are tight, sort each ride type by start time, precompute the minimal finish times for each group, and use two-pointer approach.
- **Why brute-force is acceptable:** Each land/water list has moderate length (say length n), then total pairs is n²: tractable if n is up to 1000. For much larger, need preprocessing.
- **Trade-off:** Brute-force is simplest and most general; optimized two-pointer or prefix min approaches help only for large n.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Only one land ride or one water ride (single choices).
- All rides open at the same time.
- Rides with identical durations.
- One ride starts far later than the other (must wait).
- Choosing the wrong order leads to much later finish.
- Empty land or water rides — invalid input (should not happen).
- Land ride finishes before water opens (wait required).

### Solution

```python
def earliestFinishTime(landRides, waterRides):
    min_finish = float('inf')
    
    # Try all (land, water), land first then water
    for lstart, ldur in landRides:
        land_end = lstart + ldur
        for wstart, wdur in waterRides:
            # Start water after land ends or when it opens, whichever is later
            water_actual_start = max(land_end, wstart)
            finish_time = water_actual_start + wdur
            min_finish = min(min_finish, finish_time)
    
    # Try all (water, land), water first then land
    for wstart, wdur in waterRides:
        water_end = wstart + wdur
        for lstart, ldur in landRides:
            # Start land after water ends or when it opens, whichever is later
            land_actual_start = max(water_end, lstart)
            finish_time = land_actual_start + ldur
            min_finish = min(min_finish, finish_time)
    
    return min_finish
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(L × W), where L and W are the numbers of land and water rides respectively, since all pairs are checked.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space (aside from input), as only a minimal variable is kept for current answer.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if we allow the tourist to select more than one ride in each category (multiple rides land and water in any order)?  
  *Hint: Consider dynamic programming or generalized path planning.*

- Can you do better if the data is already sorted, or if one list is much smaller than the other?  
  *Hint: Use two pointers or precompute earliest finish for each ride in sorted order.*

- Suppose the ride lists are very long (e.g., up to 10⁵ elements)—can you optimize the time complexity?  
  *Hint: For each ride, use binary search or segment tree to quickly look up earliest possible finish in the other list.*

### Summary

This problem is a classic **brute-force pairwise min/max scheduling** task. The central observation is that the only important comparisons are the *pairwise combinations* of when a pair of rides can actually be experienced in sequence, given their respective opening times. The method generalizes to other problems where tasks happen in sequence and have independent unlock/start times, and the goal is to *minimize finish time* over all orderings and pairings.
