### Leetcode 2749 (Medium): Minimum Operations to Make the Integer Zero [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-integer-zero)

### Description  
Given two integers **num1** and **num2**, your task is to make **num1** exactly **0** using the minimum number of **operations**.  
In each operation, you:
- Select any integer i such that 0 ≤ i ≤ 60,
- Subtract (2ⁱ + num2) from num1.  
Return the minimum number of operations required, or -1 if it's impossible.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `num1 = 3, num2 = -2`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:*
- Possible steps:
  - i = 0: 3 - (1 + (-2)) = 3 - (-1) = 4
  - i = 1: 4 - (2 + (-2)) = 4 - 0 = 4,
    but this doesn't help. Let's reconsider:
- Instead, do:
  - i = 2: 3 - (4 + (-2)) = 3 - 2 = 1
  - i = 1: 1 - (2 + (-2)) = 1 - 0 = 1
  - i = 0: 1 - (1 + (-2)) = 1 - (-1) = 2 (but this increases num1)
- The correct sequence is:
  - Subtract (1 + -2) = -1 three times: 3 - (-1) = 4, 4 - (-1) = 5, 5 - (-1) = 6—it doesn't work.
- However, when we try all possibilities, the *minimum* k is 3 (see *Thought Process*).

**Example 2:**  
Input: `num1 = 10, num2 = 2`  
Output: `-1`  
*Explanation:*
- If num2 is positive and too large, you may be unable to reach 0 (as you can't get num1 down to 0 by subtracting possible values).

**Example 3:**  
Input: `num1 = 12, num2 = -4`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:*
- i=2: 12 - (4 + (-4)) = 12 - 0 = 12 (no progress)
- Try i=3: 12 - (8 + (-4)) = 12 - 4 = 8
- Then i=2: 8 - (4 + -4) = 8 - 0 = 8 (again, no progress)
- But with another choice, minimal steps found are 2.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, **brute force**:  
- Try all possible numbers of operations (k from 1 up to 60).
- For each k, check if it's possible to write num1 as the sum of k terms, each term ≥ 1, of the form (2ⁱ + num2).
- For k operations, total subtracted is k \* num2 + sum of 2 raised to chosen i's.
- So, num1 = k \* num2 + sum(2ⁱ for chosen positions)
- Rearranged: num1 - k \* num2 = sum of k powers of two, i.e., num1 - k \* num2 must be positive, and can be represented as the sum of k positive powers of two (i.e., bits in binary form).

**Key insight:**  
- For each k from 1 to 60:
  - Let S = num1 - k \* num2
  - If S > 0 and the number of ‘1’ bits in S ≤ k ≤ S, it is possible (since any positive integer ≤ 2⁶⁰ can be written as sum of up to 60 powers of two).
- The *minimal* such k is the answer.

- Tradeoffs:
  - Can't represent negative S, so k must be such that num1 - k \* num2 > 0.
  - Need at least as many operations as '1's in the binary form of S.

### Corner cases to consider  
- num1 or num2 negative or zero.
- Impossible cases: S <= 0 for all k.
- num2 so large positive that num1 - k \* num2 never becomes positive.
- num2 so negative, num1 - k \* num2 grows too large, but number of '1's in S may already match k.
- num1 = 0, should return 0.
- Large numbers: ensure overflow doesn’t occur with 64-bit numbers.

### Solution

```python
def makeTheIntegerZero(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
    # Try k from 1 to 60 (since 2^60 > 1e18, covers all reasonable integer sizes)
    for k in range(1, 61):
        S = num1 - k * num2  # The remaining sum to be made of powers of two
        if S < k or S <= 0:
            continue
        # Count the number of 1s in the binary representation of S
        ones = bin(S).count('1')
        # It is possible to break S into k sum of powers of two iff ones ≤ k ≤ S
        if ones <= k <= S:
            return k
    return -1
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(60), since we only iterate k from 1 to 60 and binary analysis is fast.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1): only a few variables for computation.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if powers other than 2 were allowed (e.g., 3ⁱ + num2)?  
  *Hint: Consider digit-based representations in other bases.*

- Can you reconstruct one sequence of operations to reach zero?  
  *Hint: Backtrack the choice of i's per k, based on which bits are set in S.*

- What changes if the allowed i range is much bigger?  
  *Hint: Think about computational or overflow implications.*

### Summary
This problem uses a **bit manipulation** and **enumeration over possible numbers of operations**. The analysis reduces to checking if (num1 - k × num2) can be represented as a sum of k powers of two—i.e., the count of set bits is ≤ k. This technique is a generalization of **counting bits in integer representations**, a pattern often seen in greedy or constructive bitmask-based problems.


### Flashcard
