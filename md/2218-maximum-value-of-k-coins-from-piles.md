### LeetCode 2218 (Hard): Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-of-k-coins-from-piles)

### Description  
Imagine you have a number of piles of coins, each with different coin values. You can choose coins from the top of any pile, but you cannot skip coins within a pile. The goal is to select exactly \( k \) coins to maximize the total value.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `piles = [[1,100,3],[7,8,9]]`, `k = 2`  
Output: `101`  
Explanation:  
- Choose the top coin from the second pile (7), which totals 7.
- Choose the top coin from the first pile (1), which totals 1 + 7 = 8.
- Now, to maximize the value, choose the next top coin from the first pile (100), which totals 8 + 100 = 108. However, we only have \( k = 2 \) coins, so we reconsider our strategy. The optimal selection is taking the top coin from the first pile (1) and then the second coin from the first pile (100), totaling 101.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `piles = [,,,,,,[1,1,1,1,1,1,700]]`, `k = 7`  
Output: `706`  
Explanation:  
- The maximum total can be achieved by taking all coins from the last pile (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 700 = 706).

**Example 3:**  
Input: `piles = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]`, `k = 3`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation:  
- Every pile has the same value (1), so any combination of three coins will give a total of 3.

### Thought Process  
1. **Brute Force Approach**: Try all possible combinations of coins across the piles. This approach is time-consuming and inefficient for large inputs.
   
2. **Memoization and Dynamic Programming (DP)**: A more efficient approach is to use DP with memoization. The idea is to calculate the maximum value that can be achieved by considering each pile and the number of coins remaining. This approach breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems and avoids redundant calculations by storing results in a memoization table.

3. **Final Approach**: Use a DP approach with memoization to optimize the solution. This involves creating a recursive function that calculates the maximum value based on the current pile index and the number of coins remaining.

### Corner Cases to Consider  
- **Empty Piles**: If there are empty piles, they should not contribute to the total selection.
- **K = 0**: If \( k = 0 \), no coins should be selected, and the total value should be 0.
- **Large K**: If \( k \) is larger than the total number of coins, all coins should be selected.

### Solution

```python
def maxCoinValue(piles, k):
    # Initialize memoization table
    memo = [[-1] * (k + 1) for _ in range(len(piles) + 1)]
    
    def dp(index, remaining_coins):
        if index == 0 or remaining_coins == 0:
            return 0
        if memo[index][remaining_coins] != -1:
            return memo[index][remaining_coins]
        
        max_value = 0
        sum_coins = 0
        for taken_coins in range(min(remaining_coins, len(piles[index - 1])) + 1):
            if taken_coins > 0:
                sum_coins += piles[index - 1][taken_coins - 1]
            max_value = max(max_value, dp(index - 1, remaining_coins - taken_coins) + sum_coins)
        
        memo[index][remaining_coins] = max_value
        return max_value
    
    return dp(len(piles), k)
```

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(\Sigma |\text{piles}[i]| \times k) \). This is because for each pile and each possible number of remaining coins, we iterate over all possible taken coins from that pile.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(nk) \), where \( n \) is the number of piles. This is due to the memoization table used to store the maximum values for subproblems.

### Potential Follow-up Questions  

1. **Handling Negative Coin Values**: How would you modify the solution if some piles contain coins with negative values?  
   *Hint: Consider how negative values affect the total sum and whether they can be skipped or must be included.*

2. **Limiting the Number of Visits Per Pile**: What if you can only visit each pile a limited number of times?  
   *Hint: Introduce a constraint on the number of coins that can be taken from each pile and adjust the DP approach accordingly.*

3. **Optimizing for Large Inputs**: How can you further optimize the solution for very large inputs (e.g., thousands of piles or \( k > 1000 \))?  
   *Hint: Consider using more efficient data structures or parallel processing techniques to speed up the computation.*

### Summary  
This problem uses a dynamic programming approach with memoization to efficiently calculate the maximum value of coins that can be collected from multiple piles under the constraint of a limited number of selections. This pattern is commonly used in problems that involve optimizing over multiple options with limited resources. It can be applied to similar scenarios where you need to optimize a total value by selecting items from different sets with constraints.


### Flashcard
Use dynamic programming: dp[pile][coins] = max value from first pile piles with coins coins; consider taking 0 to min(coins, pile size) from each pile.
