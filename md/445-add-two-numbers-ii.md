### Leetcode 445 (Medium): Add Two Numbers II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii)

### Description  
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]`  
Output: `[7,8,0,7]`  
*Explanation: 7243 + 564 = 7807.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]`  
Output: `[8,0,7]`  
*Explanation: 243 + 564 = 807.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `l1 = [0], l2 = [0]`  
Output: `[0]`  

### Thought Process (as if you're the interviewee)  
This problem is similar to "Add Two Numbers I" but with a key difference: digits are stored in normal order (most significant first) instead of reverse order. This means we need to process digits from right to left (least significant first) for addition.

Approaches:
1. **Reverse both lists**: Reverse input lists, use standard addition, reverse result
2. **Use stacks**: Push all digits to stacks, then pop and add from right to left
3. **Recursive approach**: Handle carry propagation through recursion
4. **Length-based alignment**: Align shorter list with longer list and process

The stack approach is most intuitive as it naturally handles the right-to-left processing needed for addition.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Different length lists
- Carry propagation to create new most significant digit
- Lists with single zero
- One list much longer than the other
- Maximum carry scenarios
- Empty lists (though problem states non-empty)

### Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def addTwoNumbers(l1, l2):
    # Use stacks to reverse the order for addition
    stack1, stack2 = [], []
    
    # Push all digits to stacks
    while l1:
        stack1.append(l1.val)
        l1 = l1.next
    
    while l2:
        stack2.append(l2.val)
        l2 = l2.next
    
    carry = 0
    result = None
    
    # Process digits from right to left
    while stack1 or stack2 or carry:
        # Get digits (0 if stack is empty)
        digit1 = stack1.pop() if stack1 else 0
        digit2 = stack2.pop() if stack2 else 0
        
        # Calculate sum and carry
        total = digit1 + digit2 + carry
        carry = total // 10
        digit = total % 10

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(max(m, n)) where m and n are the lengths of the two linked lists. We need to traverse both lists once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(max(m, n)) for the stacks in the stack approach, or O(max(m, n)) for the recursion stack in the recursive approach.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you're the interviewer)  

- How would you solve this without using extra space for stacks?  
  *Hint: Reverse the input lists, perform addition, then reverse the result back.*

- What if the numbers could be negative?  
  *Hint: Handle sign separately and perform subtraction when signs differ.*

- How would you modify this for base-k number system instead of base-10?  
  *Hint: Replace 10 with k in carry calculations and digit extraction.*

- Can you solve this if you're not allowed to modify the input lists?  
  *Hint: The stack approach naturally preserves input lists, or create copies before reversing.*

### Summary
This problem extends the classic "Add Two Numbers" problem by reversing the digit order, requiring us to process from least significant to most significant digit. The stack-based approach elegantly handles this by naturally reversing the processing order. This pattern is useful in problems involving digit manipulation, arithmetic operations on large numbers, and scenarios where processing order matters. Understanding multiple approaches (stacks, recursion, list reversal) provides flexibility for different constraints and follow-up questions.
