### Leetcode 611 (Medium): Valid Triangle Number [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-triangle-number)

### Description  
Given an integer array, return the **number of triplets** (i, j, k) such that these three numbers can form a valid triangle—as if they represented the triangle's sides.  
A valid triangle requires that the **sum of any two sides must be greater than the remaining side**.  
Formally, for three side lengths a, b, c (where a ≤ b ≤ c), the valid triangle condition:  
a + b > c

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [2,2,3,4]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: The valid triangles are:*  
- 2,3,4 (using first 2)  
- 2,3,4 (using second 2)  
- 2,2,3

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [4,2,3,4]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: The valid triangles are:*  
- 2,3,4  
- 2,4,4  
- 3,4,4  
- 4,4,4

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [1,1,1,1]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: Every triplet forms a valid triangle: 1,1,1 (choose any 3 out of 4)*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force approach:**  
  Try all unique triplets (i, j, k) with i < j < k and check the triangle inequality for each: nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]; nums[j] + nums[k] > nums[i]; nums[k] + nums[i] > nums[j].  
  This results in O(n³) time, which is too slow for n up to 1000.

- **Optimized approach:**  
  Notice that if we **sort the array** (nums), then for any i < j < k, nums[i] ≤ nums[j] ≤ nums[k].  
  The only check needed is: nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]  
  Why? If the two smallest sides add up to more than the largest, the other two inequalities are automatically satisfied.  

  Use **two pointers** for each possible k (k from 2 to n-1), and pointers i=0, j=k-1.  
  For each k:
  - Start with i=0, j=k-1.
  - If nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k], all elements between i and j will work for this k (add j-i to count), then decrease j.
  - Otherwise, increase i.

- **Why two pointer?**  
  Because when nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k], then as i increases, the sum decreases, but as j decreases, the sum may increase. So we want to find all valid pairs efficiently.

- **Trade-off:**  
  Sorting takes O(n log n), the two pointer approach per k takes O(n), for a total of O(n²).

### Corner cases to consider  
- Array length < 3 (no possible triangles)
- Sides with zero length (triangles require positive side lengths)
- All elements are the same (combination count)
- Repeated sides
- Large values, and elements at upper/lower bounds

### Solution

```python
def triangleNumber(nums):
    # Sort the side lengths so longest side is always at the right
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0

    # Loop for the largest side, from right to the third element
    for k in range(n-1, 1, -1):
        i, j = 0, k-1
        while i < j:
            # If nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k], all pairs between i and j are valid
            if nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]:
                count += j - i
                j -= 1  # Move the right pointer left
            else:
                i += 1  # Try bigger left
    return count
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(n²) — Sorting is O(n log n), the two pointers part ranges over O(n²) combinations (O(n) per position of k).
- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(1) — If the sort is in-place (as in Python), no extra storage used except small counters/pointers.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you compute not just the count, but **all unique triangles** themselves?  
  *Hint: Modify two-pointer to record actual triplets whenever valid.*

- What if the array can be **very large (n > 10⁶)**—what optimizations or approximations can be used?  
  *Hint: Constraints on values, bucket counting, frequency maps, or combinatorial math?*

- Could there be a solution for **specific triangle types**? (e.g., only equilateral or isosceles triangles?)  
  *Hint: Hashing or counting repeated elements efficiently.*

### Summary
This problem uses the **two pointers after sorting** pattern, which converts a triple-nested loop into double loops, yielding significant speed-up.  
It’s a classic example where **ordering** the data lets you make stronger pruning and counts. Similar approaches apply to problems like three sum, counting triplets with a sum under a target, etc.
