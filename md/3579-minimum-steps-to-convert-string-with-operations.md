### Leetcode 3579 (Hard): Minimum Steps to Convert String with Operations [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-steps-to-convert-string-with-operations)

### Description  
You are given two strings, **word1** and **word2**, of equal length **n** containing only lowercase English letters. Your goal is to transform **word1** into **word2** using the minimum number of operations.  
The allowed operation is:  
- Choose **any substring** of word1 (length ≥ 1), and perform **one of these 3 operations** on that substring, all simultaneously:
    1. **Replace**: You can replace any character with another (e.g., change 'a' to 'b').
    2. **Swap**: You can swap any two characters *within* the substring.
    3. **Reverse**: You can reverse the whole substring.
You can use an operation on *any* substring any number of times, and the operation choice is per substring. Compute the **minimum number of such substring operations** needed to convert word1 to word2.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `word1 = "ab"`, `word2 = "ba"`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Take the whole string "ab" as one substring, reverse it to get "ba".*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `word1 = "abc"`, `word2 = "bca"`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:  
- First, select substring [0,2] ("abc"), reverse it to get "cba".  
- Then, select substring [1,2] ("ba"), reverse it to get "ab". Now string is "cab".  
- (But it's more optimal to swap 'a' and 'b' in one op, or do one swap and one reverse. Minimum is 2.)*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `word1 = "abcde"`, `word2 = "edcba"`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Select whole string as substring, then reverse. That matches. Only 1 operation needed.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force**: Try all possible ways to split word1 into substrings, try every combination of allowed ops. Exponential and not feasible for n ≈ 100.
- **Observation**:  
    - For any substring, you can *fully rearrange* it (via swap/reverse). So, within any selected range, you can transform its multiset of characters freely.
    - Therefore, cost is based on how to partition word1 so that chunks can become target chunks with minimal transformations.
- **DP Approach**:  
    - Let **f[i]** be the fewest ops to convert the first *i* characters of word1 to word2[0:i].
    - For every **j < i**, check partition [j, i):
        - Cost to convert word1[j:i] to word2[j:i] in **one op**? It is:
            - If, by rearrangement and replacing inside that substring, we can get target in *one* op.
            - For that, count frequency mismatch between word1[j:i] and word2[j:i]. The minimum moves needed is the count of "unmatched" pairs (with rearrangements).
        - Try all split points:
            - f[i] = min(f[j] + cost of turning word1[j:i] → word2[j:i] with one or more ops)
    - Main trick: sometimes reversing is better than forward, so check both word2[j:i] and its reverse.
- **Why this approach**: DP gives optimal substructure, and substrings can be checked in O(n² α), where α is alphabet size, per partition.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty string: Both word1 and word2 are empty.
- All letters are the same in both strings: 0 ops needed.
- word1 already equals word2: Should return 0.
- Full reverse case: Single reverse needed.
- Only single character differs: Replacement on one letter.
- Cases where best is not 1 op (patches in middle need extra).

### Solution

```python
def minOperations(word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
    n = len(word1)
    # DP array: f[i] = min ops to convert word1[0:i] to word2[0:i]
    f = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    f[0] = 0

    # Helper to calculate minimal ops for a section [l, r]
    def section_ops(l, r):
        cnt = [[0]*26 for _ in range(26)]
        res = 0
        # Try direct orientation
        for i in range(l, r+1):
            a = ord(word1[i]) - ord('a')
            b = ord(word2[i]) - ord('a')
            if a != b:
                if cnt[b][a] > 0:
                    cnt[b][a] -= 1
                else:
                    cnt[a][b] += 1
                    res += 1
        return res

    # Helper to check if we reverse the substring
    def section_ops_rev(l, r):
        cnt = [[0]*26 for _ in range(26)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(l, r+1):
            a = ord(word1[r - (i - l)]) - ord('a')
            b = ord(word2[i]) - ord('a')
            if a != b:
                if cnt[b][a] > 0:
                    cnt[b][a] -= 1
                else:
                    cnt[a][b] += 1
                    res += 1
        return res

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            # Either: transform word1[j:i] to word2[j:i] directly or via reverse
            op1 = section_ops(j, i-1)
            op2 = 1 + section_ops_rev(j, i-1)  # Reverse then minimal moves
            min_ops = min(op1, op2)
            f[i] = min(f[i], f[j] + min_ops)
    return f[n]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n³ × 26)  
    - For every endpoint (i), try all split starts (j), and for each, scan substring (i-j) for both orientations. 26 comes from alphabet size in counting.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the dp array. The counter is reused per step.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If the only allowed operation was "reverse substring", what would change?
  *Hint: Consider minimum number of intervals to flip so word1 equals word2.*

- Can you optimize the algorithm for large alphabet or smaller difference between strings?
  *Hint: Only check partitions where word1[j:i] and word2[j:i] have same character multiset.*

- How would you handle the case where word1 and word2 are not equal-length?
  *Hint: Would need insertions or deletions; problem changes fundamentally.*

### Summary
This problem connects to **DP on partitions**, string transformation, and **interval DP patterns**. The crucial insight is using the substring operation's power to freely permute, swap, and reverse, making frequency counts the main subproblem. This pattern appears in many hard DP problems where you're allowed to batch edit substrings or segments—such as edit distance with batch ops, or palindrome partitioning.
