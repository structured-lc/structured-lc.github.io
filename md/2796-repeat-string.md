### Leetcode 2796 (Easy): Repeat String [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeat-string)

### Description  
Given a string and an integer x, implement a method replicate(x) that returns the string repeated x times.  
You must not use the built-in string.repeat method.  
For example, calling `"abc".replicate(3)` should return `"abcabcabc"`.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `str = "hello", x = 2`  
Output: `"hellohello"`  
*Explanation: "hello" is repeated 2 times.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `str = "code", x = 3`  
Output: `"codecodecode"`  
*Explanation: "code" is repeated 3 times.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `str = "js", x = 1`  
Output: `"js"`  
*Explanation: "js" is repeated once, so the string stays the same.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, the brute-force approach is to initialize an empty string and append the original string to it x times in a loop. This is straightforward and readable but might not be optimal for very large x, because string concatenation inside a loop can be slow due to repeated memory allocations.

An optimization is to use a list/array, fill it with the string repeated x times, and finally join (concatenate) all elements. This reduces intermediate string reallocations and improves time complexity.

Another possible optimization (primarily theoretical for very large x) is to use "exponentiation by squaring" to reduce the number of concatenations by combining results recursively with O(log x) time, assuming string concatenation is O(1).

Given constraints (reasonable limits for x and string length, and the ask to avoid built-in `.repeat()`), the list-and-join approach is preferred due to its simplicity and efficiency.

### Corner cases to consider  
- x = 0 (should return an empty string)
- x = 1 (should return the original string unchanged)
- str = "" (empty string), any x (should return empty string)
- Very large x (test efficiency for high repetition counts)
- String with special characters or whitespace
- x is negative or non-integer (should be disallowed or treated as 0 per specification, if not, do not replicate)

### Solution

```python
# Since the original problem is for JavaScript/TypeScript, 
# but if asked for Python, we'd implement it as a function.

def repeat_string(s, times):
    """
    Repeat string s, times times, without using the built-in str * operator
    """
    # Edge case: times must be ≥ 0; if less, treat as 0 (return empty)
    if times <= 0:
        return ""
    
    result = []
    for _ in range(times):
        # Add the original string to the result list
        result.append(s)
    # Join all strings in the result list into one string
    return ''.join(result)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n × x), where n is the length of s and x is the number of repetitions. Filling the array/list is O(x), and joining is O(total length), which is n × x.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n × x) to store the final repeated string and the intermediate list (which is immediately discarded after joining).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if string concatenation is not an O(1) operation—can you optimize further?
  *Hint: Consider approaches like "exponentiation by squaring" for efficient concatenation.*

- How would you implement this if memory usage is a concern (e.g., streaming output)?
  *Hint: Can you generate the repeated string one chunk at a time, avoiding large allocations?*

- What changes if this method needs to work with unicode or surrogate pairs correctly?
  *Hint: Are there edge cases when handling multi-byte or special characters?*

### Summary
This is a classic problem about **constructing a string by repeating** a value x times.  
The core pattern is *efficient string building*, and the recommended list-then-join style is widely used to avoid inefficiencies of repeated concatenation in a loop.  
This technique appears in problems like building large strings, logging patterns, or text expansion under constraints forbidding special methods or operators.  
For advanced interviews, recognizing string exponentiation techniques is useful for extreme repetition counts.
