### Leetcode 1687 (Hard): Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/delivering-boxes-from-storage-to-ports)

### Description  
You are given a list of `boxes`, each box is `[port, weight]`, a maximum number of boxes per trip `maxBoxes`, and max weight per trip `maxWeight`. You must deliver all boxes from storage in order. Each delivery begins at storage (port 0), delivers some boxes in order, and returns. Port changes count as a new delivery stop. Return the minimum number of trips needed to deliver all boxes.

### Examples  
**Example 1:**  
Input: `boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]]`, `maxBoxes = 2`, `maxWeight = 3`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: First trip: [1,1],[2,1] (1 port change), second trip: [1,1].*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]]`, `maxBoxes = 3`, `maxWeight = 6`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Optimize trips to minimize trips and stops.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `boxes = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[2,1],[2,1],[3,3]]`, `maxBoxes = 3`, `maxWeight = 7`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: Must split based on limits and port changes.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
This is a classic DP with sliding window problem. We deliver boxes in order, never skipping. For each trip, the window must obey both maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.
- For minimum trips up to i boxes, try every valid cutoff j < i (j is where last trip started), keeping number of trips minimal.
- If we deliver boxes[j:i], we need:
  - at most maxBoxes
  - at most maxWeight
  - count port changes within this window
- Use DP: dp[i] = min over all j < i of dp[j] + cost to deliver boxes[j:i]
- For each window, track port changes efficiently, possibly with a deque or sliding window optimizations for performance.

### Corner cases to consider  
- All boxes for same port (few stops).
- Boxes where each is overweight, or maxBoxes=1 (trip per box).
- Edge cases with tight capacity (weight, boxes, or both exactly at trip limits).
- Boxes with consecutive same ports (doesn’t incur extra stop).

### Solution

```python
def boxDelivering(boxes, maxBoxes, maxWeight):
    n = len(boxes)
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)  # dp[0] = 0, i boxes delivered
    dp[0] = 0
    j = 0  # start of window
    curr_boxes = 0
    curr_weight = 0
    port_changes = 0
    last_port = 0
    from collections import deque
    q = deque()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        curr_boxes += 1
        curr_weight += boxes[i-1][1]
        if i == 1 or boxes[i-1][0] != boxes[i-2][0]:
            port_changes += 1
        while curr_boxes > maxBoxes or curr_weight > maxWeight or (j < i-1 and dp[j] == float('inf')):
            curr_boxes -= 1
            curr_weight -= boxes[j][1]
            if boxes[j][0] != boxes[j+1][0]:
                port_changes -= 1
            j += 1
        # cost: dp[j] + port_changes + 1 (out & back trip)
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + port_changes + 1)
    return dp[n]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) — Each box enters and leaves window once, scan is linear (with optimizations).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) — The dp array and possibly prefix arrays for port changes.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  
- How to optimize the window move logic to O(n)?  
  *Hint: Maintain variables carefully, use prefix/suffix pre-processing.*

- How would you handle arbitrary order of delivery?  
  *Hint: Intractable if totally arbitrary, but can sort/group by port.*

- What changes if return to storage isn’t required after every trip?  
  *Hint: Could reduce last-trip cost by 1; adapt cost calculation.*

### Summary
This is a **dynamic programming + sliding window** problem: minimize a sum over intervals with constraints. Carefully tracking port changes and window sum makes the DP linear; this pattern is common in capacity-constrained delivery, shipment, or job-processing problems, especially when minimizing grouped trip costs.
