### Leetcode 2895 (Medium): Minimum Processing Time [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-processing-time)

### Description  
You are given two arrays:  
- `processorTime`: the time when each processor becomes available (length n).
- `tasks`: the processing times of tasks to be assigned (length 4 × n; four tasks per processor).

Each processor can process four assigned tasks in parallel, starting from its available time. The completion time for each processor is determined by its available time plus the slowest (longest) task it is assigned.  
Return the **minimum possible overall processing time** needed to finish all tasks, i.e., the maximum completion time among all processors, with optimal assignment.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `processorTime = [8, 10]`, `tasks = [2,2,3,1,8,7,4,5]`  
Output: `16`  
*Explanation: Assign tasks [8,7,4,5] to processor 0 (ready at 8), and [2,2,3,1] to processor 1 (ready at 10).  
Processor 0 finishes at max(8+8,8+7,8+4,8+5)=16.  
Processor 1 finishes at max(10+2,10+2,10+3,10+1)=13.  
Overall processing time is max(16,13)=16.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `processorTime = [10, 20]`, `tasks = [2,3,1,2,5,8,4,3]`  
Output: `23`  
*Explanation: Assign [8,5,4,3] to processor 0 (ready at 10), [3,2,2,1] to processor 1 (ready at 20).  
Processor 0 finishes at max(10+8,10+5,10+4,10+3)=18.  
Processor 1 finishes at max(20+3,20+2,20+2,20+1)=23.  
Overall processing time is max(18,23)=23.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `processorTime = [1,3,2]`, `tasks = [5,2,4,1,6,8,3,7,4,7,2,5]`  
Output: `13`  
*Explanation: Assign the 4 largest tasks [8,7,7,6] to the fastest processor (ready at 1),  
the next 4 [5,5,4,4] to next fastest (ready at 2), remaining [3,2,2,1] to slowest (ready at 3).  
Processor 0: 1+8 = 9  
Processor 1: 2+5 = 7  
Processor 2: 3+3 = 6  
But check max assigned in each group, and max total. (left to user for step-by-step verification).*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, brute force would mean checking all possible ways of assigning 4 tasks to each processor, but that's extremely slow (factorial time).

The optimal approach relies on two patterns:
- Since all processors can process 4 tasks at once (in parallel), only the slowest assigned task matters for each processor.
- To minimize the *latest* finishing time, **fast processors should be given the hardest tasks**.

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort `processorTime` in ascending order (fastest first).
2. Sort `tasks` in descending order (hardest first).
3. For each processor, assign the next 4 largest remaining tasks to the next fastest processor.
4. Compute the time each processor finishes: available time + slowest assigned task.
5. The answer is the largest value among all processors.

Why this works:  
Assigning the hardest (longest duration) tasks to the processors that become available first makes the slowest task finish as soon as possible, thus minimizing the overall time.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Single processor, only 4 tasks.
- All tasks take the same time.
- All processors available at same time.
- Tasks have a huge spread (e.g., one much larger, rest small).
- Tasks or processorTime with minimum or maximum constraints of input size

### Solution

```python
def minProcessingTime(processorTime, tasks):
    # Sort processorTime so fastest (becomes available earliest) first
    processorTime.sort()
    # Sort tasks descending (largest first), so we can allocate hardest first
    tasks.sort(reverse=True)
    ans = 0
    # For each processor i, assign it the ith group of 4 hardest tasks
    for i in range(len(processorTime)):
        # The slowest task this processor gets is at index i*4 in the tasks list (since tasks sorted desc)
        finish_time = processorTime[i] + tasks[i * 4]
        ans = max(ans, finish_time)
    return ans
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n + m log m), where n is the number of processors and m is number of tasks (m=4n). Both input arrays are sorted, other operations are O(n).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra, if sorting in-place is allowed. O(n) otherwise, just from input storage.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if each processor had a different number of cores?
  *Hint: Generalize so processors can take more/less than 4 tasks.*

- What if some processors are much slower—should we ever give them hard tasks?
  *Hint: Cost of waiting vs. distributing heavy work.*

- How would you modify this solution if tasks can arrive dynamically over time?
  *Hint: Consider greedy or heap-based dynamic assignment.*

### Summary
This is a **greedy array pairing + parallel scheduling** problem—common in job scheduling, load balancing, or any batch-assign problem where you want to minimize the latest finishing time (makespan).  
The greedy "assign hardest to fastest" trick works because with parallel processing, the largest element dominates. This pattern is often used in task allocation, CPU scheduling, cloud computing resource management, and more.
