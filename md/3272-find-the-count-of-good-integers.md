### Leetcode 3272 (Hard): Find the Count of Good Integers [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-count-of-good-integers)

### Description  
Given two positive integers n and k, find how many n-digit integers are "good".  
An integer is called **good** if its digits can be rearranged to form a palindrome that is divisible by k.  
In other words, count, for given n and k, the number of n-digit numbers (no leading zeros) that can be permuted to form a k-palindromic integer (a palindromic number divisible by k).  
- n: number of digits  
- k: divisor  
- Only n-digit numbers with no leading zeros are counted.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 3, k = 5`  
Output: `27`  
*Explanation: All possible 3-digit palindromes divisible by 5 are: 505, 515, 525, 535, 545, 555, 565, 575, 585, 595, 505, 151, ..., and each has 3! permutations accounting for repeated digits. Summing all unique arrangements gives 27.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 1, k = 4`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: 4 and 8 are single-digit palindromes divisible by 4, both with 1 permutation each.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 5, k = 6`  
Output: `2468`  
*Explanation: All 5-digit palindromes divisible by 6 are considered, and the count of all n-digit permutations that can be rearranged into those palindromes yields 2468.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Brute-force Idea**:  
  - Generate all n-digit numbers, check if any permutation forms a palindrome divisible by k.
  - This is O(10ⁿ) and totally infeasible for large n.

- **Optimized Approach**:  
  - Palindrome property means the number must read the same backward and forward.  
  - Generate all n-digit palindromic numbers (be careful with odd/even n):
    - For even n: Build ⌊n/2⌋ digits, then mirror them.
    - For odd n: Build ⌊n/2⌋ digits, choose a middle digit, then mirror.
  - For each palindrome, check if it's divisible by k.
  - For each valid palindrome, count how many n-digit numbers can be permuted into this palindrome (count unique digit multiset permutations, excluding arrangements with leading zeros).

- **Permutations Counting**:
  - For each valid palindrome (represented as a digit multiset), the number of digit permutations = n! / (product of count of each repeated digit)!
  - Don't count numbers with leading zero.

- **Trade-offs**:  
  - We generate only O(10^{⌊n/2⌋}) palindromes, not all O(10ⁿ) numbers.
  - The main trick is to avoid overcounting arrangements and to account for leading zeros.

### Corner cases to consider  
- n = 1: Only single digits 1-9 are allowed (no leading zeros).
- Leading zeros in permutations: Exclude arrangements where first digit is 0.
- Palindrome with repeated digits, e.g., 11111 or 22222.
- k = 1: Every palindrome is divisible by 1.
- Very large k (no palindromes divisible by k).
- Even/odd n cases.
- All digits same (e.g., n = 3, digits are [1,1,1]).

### Solution

```python
from math import factorial
from collections import Counter

def countGoodIntegers(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    def generate_palindromes():
        # Generate all n-digit palindromes (as digit arrays, not numbers)
        half_len = n // 2
        res = []
        # The first digit cannot be 0
        for half in range(10 ** (half_len - (n%2 == 0)), 10 ** half_len):
            half_str = str(half)
            # skip numbers with leading zero
            if half_str[0] == '0':
                continue
            # Odd n: try all mid-digits
            if n % 2 == 0:
                pal = half_str + half_str[::-1]
                res.append([int(d) for d in pal])
            else:
                for mid in range(10):
                    pal = half_str + str(mid) + half_str[::-1]
                    res.append([int(d) for d in pal])
        # Special case: n==1, just digits 1-9
        if n == 1:
            for x in range(1, 10):
                res.append([x])
        return res

    def digits_to_number(digits):
        num = 0
        for d in digits:
            num = num * 10 + d
        return num

    def count_arrangements(digits):
        # Count number of unique n-digit permutations of digits (excluding leading zero)
        counter = Counter(digits)
        total = factorial(n)
        for v in counter.values():
            total //= factorial(v)
        # Remove permutations that start with 0
        if 0 in counter:
            # Put 0 at the beginning, calculate arrangements for rest
            counter0 = counter.copy()
            counter0[0] -= 1
            numer = factorial(n-1)
            denom = 1
            for v in counter0.values():
                denom *= factorial(v)
            total -= numer // denom
        return total

    palindromes = generate_palindromes()
    seen = set()
    answer = 0
    for digits in palindromes:
        num = digits_to_number(digits)
        if num % k == 0:
            digits_multiset = tuple(sorted(digits))
            if digits_multiset in seen:
                continue
            seen.add(digits_multiset)
            answer += count_arrangements(digits)
    return answer
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  - Generating palindromes: O(10^{⌊n/2⌋})
  - For each palindrome: check divisibility (O(1)), process Counter (O(n))
  - Arrangements calculation: O(n) each 
  - Overall: O(10^{⌊n/2⌋} × n), which is efficient for n up to 9.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - Storage for palindromes: O(10^{⌊n/2⌋} × n)  
  - Counter/Seen storage for multisets: O(number of unique multisets), practically much less than O(10ⁿ).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you handle cases where n is much larger (e.g., n=18)?
  *Hint: Is there a way to use digit DP or combinatorics to avoid explicit generation?*

- How would you handle if k is very large, for which very few palindromes may be divisible by k?
  *Hint: Try to prune impossible cases early, or use modular arithmetic to generate only valid candidates.*

- What changes if leading zeros are now allowed?
  *Hint: Permutations starting with 0 become valid; adjust arrangement counting accordingly.*

### Summary
This problem combines the palindrome property with permutation counting and divisibility checks.  
The solution uses enumeration of palindromes, maps permutations to digit multisets, and counts valid arrangements using combinatorics/factorials, avoiding leading zeros.  
This pattern is related to problems on **permutation/combination of multiset digits**, efficient palindrome construction, and **divisibility constraints**—applicable in advanced digit dynamic programming and number theory questions.
