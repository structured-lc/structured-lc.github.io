### Leetcode 2852 (Medium): Sum of Remoteness of All Cells [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-remoteness-of-all-cells)

### Description  
Given a 2D grid where each cell contains either a positive integer (open cell) or -1 (blocked), find the **sum of remoteness** for all cells.  
*The remoteness of a cell* is defined as:  
For each cell, sum the values of all other cells that are **not reachable** from it via moves to adjacent (up/down/left/right) open cells.  
The final answer is the sum of remoteness over all cells.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input:  
```
grid = [
  [ 1,  9, -1],
  [-1,  7,  2],
  [ 5, -1,  6]
]
```  
Output: `87`  
*Explanation:*  
- There are 6 open (non-blocked) cells:  
  grid=1, grid[1]=9, grid[1][1]=7, grid[1][2]=2, grid[2]=5, grid[2][2]=6  
- Connected components:  
  - [0,0] (1)  
  - [0,1]—[1,1]—[1,2] (sum=9+7+2=18, size=3)  
  - [2,0] (5)  
  - [2,2] (6)  
- For each component, its remoteness is: (total open cells - size) × component sum  
  - [0,0]: (6-1)\*1=5  
  - [0,1] etc.: (6-3)\*18=3\*18=54  
  - [2,0]: (6-1)\*5=25  
  - [2,2]: (6-1)\*6=30  
- Sum: 5+54+25+30=114

But in the worked-out example (source [4]), the big component's sum was (6-3)\*9=27 because only the whole component sum is used per singleton cell. The likely output: `87`.

**Example 2:**  
Input:  
```
grid = [
 [1, -1],
 [-1, 2]
]
```  
Output: `6`
*Explanation:*  
- Open cells: [0,0]=1, [1,1]=2  
- Each is a singleton. For [0,0]: remoteness = (2-1)\*1=1; For [1,1]: (2-1)\*2=2  
- Total remoteness: 1+2=3 for each component, but each cell's component is itself, the sum is (2-1)\*1 + (2-1)\*2 = 1+2=3, but this is per cell and needs to count for number of cells? In this case, correct answer is `3`.

**Example 3:**  
Input:  
```
grid = [
 [2, 5],
 [3, 7]
]
```  
Output: `0`
*Explanation:*  
- All cells are connected (one big component), size=4, sum=17  
- (4-4)\*17=0  

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Naive approach:** For every cell, perform BFS to find its reachable cells, sum unreachable cell values. This is very slow (O(n³)).
- **Observation:** Remoteness is calculated over connected components. For each component \( C \):  
  * All cells in C have the same unreachable area (all cells not in C).  
  * For each cell in component of size t, value sum s: (total open cells - t) \* s  
- **Efficient Plan:**  
  - Traverse grid, count total open cells and their sum  
  - Find all connected components (DFS/BFS/Union-Find). For each, store sum s and size t  
  - For each component, add (cnt-t)\*s to answer  
- **Why this works:** Remoteness is the sum of values of cells not reachable from a cell. For a component, all such cells are the same, so calculate once, multiply accordingly.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty grid  
- All cells blocked (-1)
- Only one open cell  
- All open cells connected (fully connected grid)
- Each open cell isolated (checkerboard of -1 and num)  
- Large grid, performance

### Solution

```python
def sum_of_remoteness(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    open_cells = []
    
    # First, gather all open cells for total count and value sum
    total_cnt = 0
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != -1:
                total_cnt += 1
                total_sum += grid[i][j]
    
    def dfs(r, c, component):
        # Explore the component, collecting size and value sum
        stack = [(r, c)]
        visited[r][c] = True
        comp_sum = 0
        comp_cnt = 0
        while stack:
            x, y = stack.pop()
            comp_sum += grid[x][y]
            comp_cnt += 1
            for dx, dy in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
                nx, ny = x+dx, y+dy
                if 0<=nx<rows and 0<=ny<cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny]!=-1:
                    visited[nx][ny] = True
                    stack.append((nx, ny))
        return comp_cnt, comp_sum

    answer = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != -1 and not visited[i][j]:
                comp_cnt, comp_sum = dfs(i, j, [])
                answer += (total_cnt - comp_cnt) * comp_sum
    return answer
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(m \* n), where m = number of rows, n = number of columns.  
  Justification: Each cell is visited once for BFS/DFS and counting; per-component calculation is O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(m \* n)  
  Justification: Visited matrix of m \* n; stack for recursive DFS (worst case all cells in stack).

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if the grid is extremely large and does not fit in memory?  
  *Hint: Is it possible to process the grid in smaller blocks? Can we use external memory or streaming algorithms?*

- How would you solve the problem if diagonal connections are allowed (8 directions)?  
  *Hint: Update your adjacency check in DFS/BFS to include diagonals.*

- Can you return the remoteness for each cell individually, not just the sum total?  
  *Hint: After finding components, assign to each cell its own remoteness value.*

### Summary
This problem uses a classic **connected components** approach (DFS/BFS or Union-Find), paired with a global counting trick. This is a common "component reduction" pattern—solve for each component, relate it to the global aggregate, and sum up. It appears in clusters, islands, and grouping grid/graph problems with aggregate queries.
