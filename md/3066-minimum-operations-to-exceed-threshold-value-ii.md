### Leetcode 3066 (Medium): Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-exceed-threshold-value-ii)

### Description  
Given an integer array **nums** and an integer **k**, you can repeatedly do the following operation:  
Pick the two smallest elements \(x\) and \(y\) (where \(x \leq y\)), remove them from the array, then add  
`min(x, y) × 2 + max(x, y)` into the array.  
Your goal: Make every element in the array **≥ k** with the minimum number of operations.  
Return the minimum operations needed, or -1 if it is not possible (when only one element remains, and it's < k).

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3], k = 10`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:*
- First, pick 1, 2 → add `min(1,2)×2 + max(1,2) = 1×2 + 2 = 4`
- New array: `[3,4]`
- Next, pick 3, 4 → add `3×2 + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10`
- New array: `` (all elements ≥ 10)
- 2 operations.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [5,5,5], k = 11`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation:*
- Pick 5, 5 → add `5×2 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15`
- New array: `[5,15]`
- Both 5 and 15? No; array has two elements, but need all ≥ 11.
- Pick 5, 15 → add `5×2 + 15 = 10 + 15 = 25`
- Now only one element (25) and 25 ≥ 11
- 2 operations.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [1,1,1], k = 10`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation:*
- Pick 1, 1 → add `1×2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
- New array: `[1,3]`
- Pick 1, 3 → add `1×2 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5`
- Now only `[5]`, not ≥ k, and only one element left. Impossible.
- Output: `-1`

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

First, brute-force:  
- At each step, try all pairs, combine, add new element, repeat.
- This is extremely inefficient for large n.

Optimal:
- Realize we must always combine the two smallest numbers for best growth (like "minimum effort" type heap problems).
- Use a min-heap to always extract the two smallest.
- Perform the operation, insert the result back.
- Stop when all numbers in heap are ≥ k, or when only one left < k (impossible).

This approach is efficient (heapify + log n per operation).
Tradeoff:  
- Uses O(n) space for heap.
- Greedy is provably optimal — if you ever skip two smallest, you delay growth.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Input already: all elements ≥ k → 0 operations.
- Only two elements, and they can't reach k after operation.
- Only one element < k at start (impossible by constraints).
- Multiple duplicate small numbers.
- Large numbers, integer overflow (depending on language).
- After operation, array size decreases by 1 each time.

### Solution

```python
import heapq

def min_operations(nums, k):
    # Convert nums to a min-heap
    heapq.heapify(nums)
    ops = 0
    
    # Early exit: already satisfies condition
    if all(val >= k for val in nums):
        return 0

    while len(nums) > 1:
        # Check if smallest is already >= k
        if nums[0] >= k:
            return ops
        # Pop two smallest elements
        x = heapq.heappop(nums)
        y = heapq.heappop(nums)
        # Compute new number as per problem rules
        new_num = min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)
        heapq.heappush(nums, new_num)
        ops += 1

    # Check for the last remaining element
    return ops if nums[0] >= k else -1
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
  - Initial heapify: O(n)
  - Each operation: removes 2, inserts 1 (max n-1 ops), each op O(log n)
  - So, O(n log n) overall.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
  - Heap with up to n elements.
  - Only a few temp integers for each operation.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- If you could combine more than two numbers at a time, how would you generalize the solution?  
  *Hint: Consider k-way priority queue merging strategies.*

- What if you could only combine adjacent elements?  
  *Hint: Can you still use a heap, or do you need dynamic programming or a sliding-window approach?*

- How to handle large values to prevent integer overflow?  
  *Hint: Can you work with arbitrary precision integers, or need to cap at max allowed value?*

### Summary
This is a **heap/greedy coding pattern**: always merge the smallest to grow quickly toward the goal, similar to problems like "Minimum Cost to Connect Ropes."  
Patterns involving min-heap for repeated merging of minimums appear in greedy optimization, Huffman coding, and resource consolidation scenarios.  
This approach is robust for any scenario where local minimum greediness leads to global optimality.
