### Leetcode 1359 (Hard): Count All Valid Pickup and Delivery Options [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-all-valid-pickup-and-delivery-options)

### Description  
Given n orders, each order consists of a pickup and a delivery. You must count all valid sequences for these steps such that for every order i, deliveryᵢ always happens after pickupᵢ. Return the count modulo 10⁹+7.

For example, with 2 orders, the steps are P1, D1, P2, D2. Valid sequences must ensure for all i, Dᵢ appears somewhere after Pᵢ.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 1`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: Only one sequence: (P1, D1), which is valid since D1 is after P1.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 2`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation:  
The valid sequences (P = pickup, D = delivery):  
(P1, P2, D1, D2)  
(P1, P2, D2, D1)  
(P1, D1, P2, D2)  
(P2, P1, D1, D2)  
(P2, P1, D2, D1)  
(P2, D2, P1, D1)  
Each Dᵢ is after Pᵢ.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 3`  
Output: `90`  
*Explanation: There are 90 valid sequences for 3 orders. (Omitted for brevity)*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- Brute-force:  
  Try to generate every permutation of all P and D steps. For each permutation, check that for each i, Dᵢ comes after Pᵢ. But with 2n steps, the total number of permutations is (2n)!, which explodes even for moderate n.

- Pattern/Recursion:  
  At any stage, we can insert a new pickup (Pₙ) and its delivery (Dₙ) into all valid (n-1) orderings.
  
  For n = 1, answer = 1.
  
  For each recursion (going from n-1 to n), we have 2n-1 choices to insert the new pickup (Pₙ), and for each such arrangement, (after placing pickup), we have (2n-1) possible positions to insert Dₙ after Pₙ. But the key is:
  
  When we have k pairs, the total number of valid ways is:  
  resultₖ = resultₖ₋₁ × (2k-1) × k

  Why?  
  - There are (2k-1) positions to insert a new pair.
  - For each arrangement, there are k ways to pair the delivery after the pickup.

- Dynamic Programming:  
  Bottom-up DP using the above recurrence:  
  dp[1] = 1  
  dp[k] = dp[k-1] × (2k-1) × k

- Final formula:  
  For each order from 2 to n, multiply by (2i-1) × i, always taking modulo 10⁹+7.

#### Why not backtracking?  
Because the number of sequences is huge; combinatorial reasoning gives us a much faster O(n) solution.

### Corner cases to consider  
- n = 1 (smallest case, only one way)
- Large n (testing for modulo operation, integer overflow)
- Modulo edge: make sure code uses modulus at every multiplication
- Correct for n = 2, 3 by hand

### Solution

```python
def countOrders(n):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    res = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # For each i, (2i - 1) possible slots to place iᵗʰ pickup and delivery,
        # and i! ways for delivery after pickup inside those slots
        res = res * i * (2 * i - 1) % MOD
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), because we loop from 2 up to n and do constant time computation each iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of n.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Given the sequence, check if it's a valid pickup/delivery order.  
  *Hint: Use a stack to ensure deliveries don't occur before pickups.*

- Can you compute the sequence without using large multiplications?  
  *Hint: Use modular arithmetic at each step to avoid overflow.*

- What is the closed formula for the number of valid sequences?  
  *Hint: It's the product: Π (i × (2i - 1)) for i = 1..n.*

### Summary
This is a typical combinatorics/permutation problem with constraints, leading to a product formula, similar to catalan numbers in structure. It's solved using a recurrence/formula and can often be tackled with DP or counting techniques. This pattern arises in problems involving pairing objects and order constraints, such as valid parentheses, handshakes, or other stack-based sequence validations.
