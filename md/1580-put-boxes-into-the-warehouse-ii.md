### Leetcode 1580 (Medium): Put Boxes Into the Warehouse II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/put-boxes-into-the-warehouse-ii)

### Description  
You are given an array boxes with the heights of each box, and an array warehouse representing the heights of the warehouse sections arranged left to right. Place each box into any warehouse section, as long as the box fits (height ≤ warehouse section). Each box can only be placed in one section and each section only holds one box. Return the maximum number of boxes that can be put into the warehouse.

### Examples  
**Example 1:**  
Input: `boxes = [4,3,4,1]`, `warehouse = [5,3,3,4,1]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: Place boxes of heights 4,3,1 in warehouse slots from left to right.*  

**Example 2:**  
Input: `boxes = [1,2,2,3,4]`, `warehouse = [3,4,1,2]`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: One way: boxes 1,2,2 to warehouse 3,4,2.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `boxes = [3,5,4,1]`, `warehouse = [7,10,5,5,2,2,7]`  
Output: `4`  
*Explanation: All boxes fit: place 1 in slot 2, 3 in leftmost, 4 in next available, and 5 in one of the fives.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
The best strategy is to maximize how many boxes you can place in the warehouse. Since some warehouse sections restrict what you can insert to their minimum height so far from the left (because you can't push a tall box through a low slot), preprocess warehouse to enforce that each slot is at most as tall as all previous from the left (non-increasing min). Next, sort the list of boxes (ascending). Try to place smallest boxes in the tightest spots. Greedily try to fit smallest boxes into smallest warehouse slots.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Boxes that are all larger than warehouse slots (output should be 0).
- More boxes than warehouse slots.
- Some warehouse slots don't fit any box.

### Solution

```python
def maxBoxesInWarehouse(boxes, warehouse):
    boxes.sort()
    n = len(warehouse)
    min_heights = warehouse[:]
    # Make each slot no taller than the slots before it
    for i in range(1, n):
        min_heights[i] = min(min_heights[i], min_heights[i-1])
    res = 0
    i, j = 0, n - 1
    while i < len(boxes) and j >= 0:
        if boxes[i] <= min_heights[j]:
            res += 1
            i += 1
        j -= 1
    return res
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n + m), from sort and the one-pass for fitting boxes (n = boxes, m = warehouse).
- **Space Complexity:** O(m), for min heights array.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  
- What if you can reorder the warehouse slots?
  *Hint: Is greedy still valid?*
- What if slots have widths and boxes have both height and width?
  *Hint: Need a 2D fit: try bin-packing or DP.*
- What if some slots can hold more than one box?
  *Hint: Simulate via capacity array, and fit multiple boxes accordingly.*

### Summary
This problem uses greedy + pre-processing. Min-height prefix allows us to correctly model warehouse entry limits, and greedy fit of boxes ensures we maximize placement. The pattern is common for 'fit as many as possible' type interval and bin-packing problems.


### Flashcard
Preprocess warehouse to non-increasing min heights, sort boxes ascending, then greedily fit smallest boxes into tightest slots.
