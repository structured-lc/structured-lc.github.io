### Leetcode 1785 (Medium): Minimum Elements to Add to Form a Given Sum [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-elements-to-add-to-form-a-given-sum)

### Description  
Given an integer array **nums**, and two integers **limit** and **goal**, you need to make the sum of **nums** equal to **goal**. You can add any number of elements to **nums**, each in the range **[-limit, limit]** (inclusive).  
Return the **minimum number of elements** you must add so that the sum of the array equals **goal**.  
The array must still maintain the property that every element stays within **[-limit, limit]**.  

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1, -1, 1], limit = 3, goal = -4`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: The array sum is 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1. To reach -4, you need to add -2 and -3 (for example). The total sum: 1 + (-2) + (-3) = -4. Thus, 2 elements are needed.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1, -10, 9, 1], limit = 100, goal = 0`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation: The array sum is 1 - 10 + 9 + 1 = 1. To reach 0, add -1 (which is within [-100, 100]). Only 1 element is needed.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [-3, 2], limit = 5, goal = 10`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation: The array sum is -3 + 2 = -1. To reach 10, need to add 11. You can use three additions: 5, 5, and 1. All are within [-5, 5].*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, I’d find the current sum of the array. The gap to fill is the absolute difference between **goal** and this sum. In order to use as few moves as possible, I should always use the largest possible "step," that is, add numbers with absolute value equal to **limit**: either **limit** or **-limit** as appropriate for the sign of the gap.  
Thus, the minimum number of insertions needed is `ceil(diff / limit)`, where `diff` is abs(goal - sum). If there's a remainder, we need one more move to cover it.  
This approach is efficient and greedy—it always makes the optimal (biggest possible) progress in each step.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty array (nums = []).  
- The sum already matches the goal → no insertions needed.  
- Large or small limits (limit = 1 or very big).  
- Negative or positive goal, or both.  
- Edge case where diff is exactly divisible by limit (no remainder).

### Solution

```python
def minElements(nums, limit, goal):
    # Calculate the current sum of the array
    current_sum = sum(nums)
    # Compute the absolute difference to the goal
    diff = abs(goal - current_sum)
    # If already at the goal, nothing to add
    if diff == 0:
        return 0
    # Calculate minimum number of additions
    quotient = diff // limit
    remainder = diff % limit
    # If there's a remainder, need one extra element
    if remainder > 0:
        return quotient + 1
    else:
        return quotient
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n = len(nums), since we sum the array and do constant-time math afterward.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), no extra space used except a few variables.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if limit can change for each add?  
  *Hint: Consider dynamic programming or greedy per step.*

- What if added elements can only be positive or only negative?  
  *Hint: You may not always be able to reach the goal. Check gap sign.*

- What if you need to record which elements are added, not only the count?  
  *Hint: Greedily pick ±limit until close, then fill remaining with smallest value.*

### Summary
This problem uses a **greedy algorithm**: always cover the gap using the largest allowed (by limit) step size, minimizing the number of insertions. This is a classic “cover-by-steps”/integer division ceil pattern, seen in coin change (unlimited coins, single denomination) and jump problems. The main coding pattern is basic arithmetic, combined with a greedy loop or division-based calculation.
