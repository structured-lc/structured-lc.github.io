### Leetcode 2892 (Medium): Minimizing Array After Replacing Pairs With Their Product [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimizing-array-after-replacing-pairs-with-their-product)

### Description  
You're given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You can repeatedly perform the following operation: choose two adjacent elements, `x` and `y`, where `x × y ≤ k`, and merge them into one element equal to `x × y`. The goal is to merge elements as much as possible so that the **final array is as short as possible**. Return this minimum possible length.

- Only adjacent elements can be merged.
- The operation can be done any number of times in any order.
- If at any time their product is greater than `k`, you have to stop merging at that point.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 5`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:*
- Merge 1 and 2 (\(1 × 2 = 2 ≤ 5\)): Array becomes [2, 3, 4].
- Cannot merge 2 and 3 as \(2 × 3 = 6 > 5\).
- Final array length = 3.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1], k = 1`  
Output: `1`  
*Explanation:*
- Always possible to merge any two adjacent 1's (\(1 × 1 = 1 ≤ 1\)).
- Merge 1 & 1 ⇒ [1, 1, 1] → merge 1 & 1 ⇒ [1, 1] → merge 1 & 1 ⇒ [1].
- Final array length = 1.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `nums = [3, 6, 2, 7], k = 10`  
Output: `3`  
*Explanation:*
- 3 × 6 = 18 > 10 (cannot merge first two)
- 6 × 2 = 12 > 10 (cannot merge next two)
- 2 × 7 = 14 > 10 (cannot merge last two)
- No merges possible. Final length = 4.


### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
First, the brute-force idea would be:  
- Try all possible ways to merge any mergeable adjacent pairs in any order, recursively, and track the minimum resulting length.
- This quickly becomes exponential since each operation can change downstream merge options.

Optimization:  
- Notice that **merges are local and greedy**: once two numbers can be merged (product ≤ k), it's always optimal to merge them immediately.
- Thus, traverse the array from left to right, always trying to merge as much as allowed.
- After merging, replace the merged pair with the product and check its next neighbor; repeat as needed.

The problem boils down to **greedily compressing every possible merge segment** as soon as product allows.  
Why it works: Because merging does not improve by delaying—the merged product will not *decrease*, so later merges only get less likely.

Trade-offs:  
- This is O(n): single pass with a stack to track reducible products.
- No complicated recursion; no need to try all orders.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Single element array (already minimal)
- All elements are 1 and k ≥ 1 (can always fully merge)
- Zeros in array (0 × anything = 0, always can merge if k ≥ 0)
- No possible merges (all adjacent products > k)
- Large numbers with small k (forces minimal length)
- Large k (can merge full array into one)
- Negative numbers (not specified, but if allowed, watch multiplication rules)

### Solution

```python
def minimizeArrayLength(nums, k):
    # Use a stack to simulate merging from left to right
    stack = []
    for num in nums:
        # Try to merge as much as possible with stack top
        while stack and stack[-1] * num <= k:
            num = stack.pop() * num
        # After merging, push current number
        stack.append(num)
    # The stack size is the minimal possible length
    return len(stack)
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) — Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) — In worst case (no merges), stack holds all n elements.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if merging is only allowed for specific pairs (not just adjacent)?
  *Hint: How would the time complexity change if you could merge any pair, not just neighbors?*
- What would change if we want the **maximum** possible array length after such merges?
  *Hint: Can you always avoid merges, or are merges forced?*
- How would you extend this to support **range queries** (given an interval in nums, answer minimal length after applying merges just in that range)?
  *Hint: Which data structures handle such segment-wise reductions efficiently?*

### Summary
This problem is an example of the **Greedy Stack pattern**: always merge immediately when allowed, left-to-right, tracking the current minimal representation. It's a classic case of "greedy is optimal" because local merging choices cannot harm future options (the product only stays the same or grows). This pattern shows up in merge/reduce/consolidate scenarios (e.g., "merge stones with cost", "remove k digits to minimize number", etc.), where the constraints enforce a unique best reduction strategy.


### Flashcard
Traverse left to right, greedily merge adjacent pairs whose product ≤ k to minimize array length; always merge when possible.
