### Leetcode 2472 (Hard): Maximum Number of Non-overlapping Palindrome Substrings [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-non-overlapping-palindrome-substrings)

### Description  
Given a string `s` and a positive integer `k`, select as many non-overlapping substrings as possible from `s` such that:
- Each substring is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
- Each substring has length at least `k`.
Return the maximum number of non-overlapping palindrome substrings you can select.
Substrings *must* be non-overlapping.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s="abaccdbbd", k=3`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: The substrings "aba" and "dbbd" are both palindromes of length ≥ 3 and do not overlap. There is no way to select a third such non-overlapping palindrome.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s="adbcda", k=2`  
Output: `0`  
*Explanation: There is no palindrome substring of length at least 2 in the input.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s="aabbbaa", k=3`  
Output: `2`  
*Explanation: We can select "aabbaa" and "a" or "abbba" and "a", as both are palindromes with length ≥ 3 and non-overlapping. Max is 2.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  

Start by thinking of the brute-force approach:  
- Try every possible combination of non-overlapping substrings of length at least `k`, check if each is a palindrome, and count the maximum number found.  
This is **intractable** for the problem constraints (up to 2000 characters).

**Key observations and optimizations:**  
- We need to find and select palindromic substrings as early as possible, then jump to the next possible start (non-overlapping requirement).
- Precompute all substrings that are palindromes using dynamic programming (DP).
    - Use a 2D boolean array `is_palindrome[i][j]`: is substring `s[i:j+1]` a palindrome?
- Use a **1D DP**:  
    - Let `dp[i]` = maximum palindromic substrings in `s[0:i]` (i inclusive).
    - For each position `i`, consider not taking any palindrome ending at `i`, or for each `j` from `i-k+1` to `0`, if `s[j:i+1]` is a palindrome, then try `dp[j-1]+1`.
    - Take the max across all choices.
- Alternatively, can use **DFS + memoization**: At every index, try to take or skip all palindrome substrings starting at that index, using cache to avoid recomputation.

Chose DP for its iterative nature and simple history tracking.

**Trade-offs:**  
- DP table for palindromes uses O(n²) space, but allows quick checks.
- DP solution time is O(n²), acceptable for n ≤ 2000.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Input `s` has no palindromic substrings of length ≥ k → should return 0.
- Entire string `s` is a palindrome of length ≥ k → should count as 1.
- `k = 1` → every single character is a palindrome, so select as many non-overlapping as possible.
- All characters are unique → only palindromes of length 1.
- Multiple overlapping palindromes — ensure picking non-overlapping only (skip after taking one).

### Solution

```python
def max_palindromes(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    # is_palindrome[i][j] means s[i:j+1] is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        is_palindrome[i][i] = True
    for i in range(n-1):
        is_palindrome[i][i+1] = (s[i] == s[i+1])

    # Expand for length > 2
    for length in range(3, n+1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            is_palindrome[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) and is_palindrome[i+1][j-1]

    # dp[i]: max number of non-overlapping palindromic substrings in s[0:i+1]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        # At least as many as before (possibly with no new palindrome ending at i)
        if i > 0:
            dp[i] = dp[i-1]
        # Try ending a palindrome at i, need substrings of length at least k
        for j in range(i - k + 1, -1, -1):
            if is_palindrome[j][i]:
                if j == 0:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1)
                else:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j-1] + 1)
    return dp[-1]
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²), due to:
    - O(n²) time to fill the is_palindrome table (nested loops).
    - For each `i`, inner loop up to O(n), for all n positions.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n²), for the palindrome DP table; O(n) for the main dp array.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- How would you optimize space for the is_palindrome table?  
  *Hint: You only need the previous results for j+1 and i-1; can you do it in-place or using less memory, especially for large `n`?*

- How would you modify the solution if you are allowed to have overlapping palindromic substrings?  
  *Hint: The non-overlapping requirement is what prompts skipping ahead; without it, what's the pattern?*

- Could you recover the actual substrings selected, not just their count?  
  *Hint: Use a parent array to track choices or keep the start index of each palindrome.*

### Summary
This problem is a classic application of interval dynamic programming with palindrome detection as a preprocessing step.  
The approach combines a 2D table for quick palindrome checks and a 1D DP for optimal substructure over non-overlapping intervals.  
The pattern—interval/substring-based DP with palindrome checking—arises frequently in Leetcode Hard/Medium DP problems, including those involving cuts, splits, and substring parsing (e.g., Palindrome Partitioning, Longest Palindromic Substring).


### Flashcard
Use DP to greedily select earliest palindromic substrings of length ≥ k, skipping to the next non-overlapping position each time.
