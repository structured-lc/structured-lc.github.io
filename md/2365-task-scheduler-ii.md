### Leetcode 2365 (Medium): Task Scheduler II [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler-ii)

### Description  
Given a list of **tasks** (an array of integers), where tasks[i] represents the type of task to run on the iᵗʰ day, and an integer **space**, you must execute tasks in order. Any time you run the same type of task again, you must wait **at least `space` days** (inclusive) since it was last executed. On any day, you can:
- Complete the next available task, or
- Wait (take a break).

Return the **minimum number of days** needed to complete all tasks, given the cool-down constraint.  
(You can't rearrange tasks; they must be done in the given order.)

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `tasks = [1,2,1,2,3,1], space = 3`  
Output: `9`  
*Explanation:  
- Day 1: Do task 1.  
- Day 2: Do task 2.  
- Day 3: Must wait, since task 1 was just done on day 1 (needs 3-day gap).  
- Day 4: Must wait.  
- Day 5: Do task 1 (done on day 1, now on day 5, gap of 4 days ≥ space+1).  
- Day 6: Do task 2 (was on day 2, gap of 4 days).  
- Day 7: Do task 3.  
- Day 8: Must wait, since last time did task 1 was day 5.  
- Day 9: Do task 1 (last done on day 5, now on day 9).*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `tasks = [5,8,8,5], space = 2`  
Output: `6`  
*Explanation:  
- Day 1: Do task 5  
- Day 2: Do task 8  
- Day 3: Must wait (can't do 8, done on day 2)  
- Day 4: Do task 8 (now last 8 was on day 4; gap of 2+1)  
- Day 5: Must wait (can't do 5, last done on day 1)  
- Day 6: Do task 5*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `tasks = [2,2,2,2], space = 1`  
Output: `7`  
*Explanation:  
- Day 1: Do 2  
- Day 2: Wait  
- Day 3: Do 2  
- Day 4: Wait  
- Day 5: Do 2  
- Day 6: Wait  
- Day 7: Do 2*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- **Naive idea:** For each task, check when it was last executed. If the required gap hasn't passed, count "wait" days until it can be done. This leads to unnecessary loops and slow performance (O(n\*n)), especially for many repeating tasks.
- **Optimized approach:**  
  - Use a hash map to record, for each task type, the earliest day it can next be executed.
  - As we iterate, simulate days:
    - If today is earlier than that task's next allowed day, we have to jump forward ("wait") to the allowed day.
    - Otherwise, do the task today.
    - After performing a task, update its next allowed day to today + space + 1.
  - Result: Only O(n) time and O(n) space.
- **Trade-offs:**  
  - This method works because order must be preserved, so skipping tasks isn't allowed.  
  - The map lets us efficiently check next-available-day for each type, rather than looping over days.

### Corner cases to consider  
- Empty tasks array → should return 0.
- Unique tasks, space > 0 → no waiting needed.
- All tasks the same, large `space` → many waits, days increase rapidly.
- space = 0 (no cooldown) → should finish in exactly `len(tasks)` days.
- Tasks where repeats are spaced naturally ≥ space.

### Solution

```python
def taskSchedulerII(tasks, space):
    # Map to track next available day for each task
    next_available = dict()
    day = 1  # Days are 1-based
    
    for t in tasks:
        # If current day < next_available[t], need to advance day to when we can do t
        if t in next_available and day < next_available[t]:
            day = next_available[t]
        # Schedule task on 'day' (may have advanced due to waits)
        # Next time this task can be done: day + space + 1
        next_available[t] = day + space + 1
        day += 1  # Move to next day for the next task
    
    # Subtract 1 because 'day' is incremented one extra time after last scheduled
    return day - 1
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n = len(tasks); we process each task in order, each hash lookup and update is O(1) amortized.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m), where m = number of unique tasks; hash map stores next-available-day for each unique task.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- What if you could schedule tasks in any order, not just the given order?  
  *Hint: Try greedy methods or priority queues.*

- How would you optimize if the number of distinct tasks is much smaller than the total number of tasks?  
  *Hint: Does the current space complexity suffice?*

- Can you explain why we use day + space + 1 as the next available day for a task?  
  *Hint: Carefully consider what the "space" means for cooldown and ordering.*

### Summary
This problem is a variation of the "Task Scheduler" classic, applying *cooldown constraints* to forced task orders. The main coding pattern is simulating day-by-day task scheduling — using a hash map to efficiently track cooldowns, yielding fast O(n) time. This pattern appears in other cooldown/timestamp simulation scenarios, and is relevant for problems where cooldowns or temporal constraints matter, especially process scheduling or rate-limiting algorithms.


### Flashcard
Track each task's next allowed day in a hash map; if current day < next allowed, jump to that day; update next allowed to current_day + space + 1.
