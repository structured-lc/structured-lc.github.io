### Leetcode 2396 (Medium): Strictly Palindromic Number [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/strictly-palindromic-number)

### Description  
Given an integer n, a number is called **strictly palindromic** if, when you write it in every base b from 2 up to n−2, its representation is always a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forward and backward). Your task is to implement a function that returns `True` if n is strictly palindromic, and `False` otherwise.

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 4`  
Output: `False`  
*Explanation: In base 2, 4 is “100” (not a palindrome). In base 3, 4 is “11” (a palindrome). However, it is not a palindrome in every base between 2 and 2 (which is only base 2 in this case), so it already fails for base 2.*

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 5`  
Output: `False`  
*Explanation: Check base 2 (5="101", palindrome), base 3 (5="12", not a palindrome), base 4 (5="11", palindrome). Because it fails for base 3, it is not strictly palindromic.*

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 9`  
Output: `False`  
*Explanation: For base 2: 9="1001" (palindrome). For base 3: 9="100" (not a palindrome). 9 is not strictly palindromic.*

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
To solve this, I first consider a brute force approach: For each base b from 2 to n−2, convert n into a string representing the number in base b, then check if that string is a palindrome. If we find any base for which the representation isn’t a palindrome, return False.

But before implementing this, let's consider the mathematical properties:

- For any n ≥ 4, in base n−2, n’s representation is always "2" (since n = 1 × (n−2) + 2), which is trivially a palindrome.
- In base n−1, n is "11".
- However, for n ≥ 5, in base 2, the representation is always more than 2 digits and often not a palindrome.
- In fact, it turns out that **no integer n ≥ 4 is strictly palindromic**, as shown by mathematical proof (there will always be a base where it fails).

Thus, the function can always just return False for n ≥ 4.

### Corner cases to consider  
- n < 4: For n = 1, 2, 3, there are no bases between 2 and n−2, so the definition is vacuously true, but the problem constraints only require us to answer for n ≥ 4.
- Very large values of n.
- Palindromes in edge bases (n−2, n−1).

### Solution

```python
def isStrictlyPalindromic(n: int) -> bool:
    # By mathematical proof, no n >= 4 is strictly palindromic
    return False
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(1). We return the result without computation, as no n ≥ 4 is strictly palindromic.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). No extra storage is used.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Can you prove why no number ≥ 4 can be strictly palindromic?  
  *Hint: Test representations in base 2 and base n−2.*

- Can you find a number that is palindromic in all but one base between 2 and n−2?  
  *Hint: Manually check small examples (try n = 5, 6, 7, etc).*

- For what n is the definition vacuously true?  
  *Hint: What does the set of bases {2, ..., n−2} look like for n = 2, 3?*

### Summary

This problem is a mathematical brainteaser rather than an implementation-heavy coding question. The insight is recognizing, through proof or pattern, that there are no strictly palindromic numbers according to the definition for n ≥ 4. As a result, the answer for all valid input values is simply False. The pattern is rare in interview problems but illustrates the importance of recognizing mathematical impossibility and leveraging proofs over brute force computation.
