### Leetcode 3503 (Medium): Longest Palindrome After Substring Concatenation I [Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome-after-substring-concatenation-i)

### Description  
Given two strings **s** and **t**, you may select any (possibly empty) substring from **s** and any (possibly empty) substring from **t**, then concatenate them (substring from **s** first, then from **t**) to create a new string.  
Return the length of the **longest palindrome** that can be formed in this way.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.  
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.  
Both substrings can be empty (which is itself a palindrome of length 0).

### Examples  

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "a"`, `t = "a"`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation: Take `"a"` from `s` and `"a"` from `t`, concatenation `"aa"` is a palindrome of length 2.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "abc"`, `t = "def"`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: No matching chars; the best palindrome is any single character (like `"a"`), length 1.

**Example 3:**  
Input: `s = "b"`, `t = "aaaa"`  
Output: `4`  
Explanation: Take `"aaaa"` from `t`, which is already a palindrome, length 4.

**Example 4:**  
Input: `s = "abcde"`, `t = "ecdba"`  
Output: `5`  
Explanation: Take `"abc"` from `s` and `"ba"` from `t`, concatenate for `"abcba"`, which is a palindrome of length 5.

### Thought Process (as if you’re the interviewee)  
- Brute-force would generate all substrings for both `s` and `t`, concatenate each pair, and check for palindrome, updating the max length found.  
 - Substrings for string of length n: O(n²) possible for each, total pairs: O(n⁴). For n=30, that's (30\*31/2)² ≈ 216225.  
 - For each pair, palindrome check is O(L) where L ≤ 60. This is acceptable for the constraints.

- We optimize by noticing:
 - We only need to check unique substring pairs.  
 - Starting with all substrings of both strings, for each, concatenate and check palindrome.

- To maximize efficiency:
 - For each possible split length (from 0 up to len(s)), try all substrings and check concatenations.
 - Alternately, precompute all substrings of both, then for all combinations, check palindromes.

- Since both s and t have length ≤ 30, the total number of substrings is manageable.
- Manacher’s algorithm or hashing is overkill for this constraint.  
- To further optimize:
 - Since substrings can be empty, consider palindromes from s only or t only, not just s+t.
 - Try all substrings from s (empty to full), all substrings from t (empty to full).
 - For any substring from s, any substring from t, check if s_sub + t_sub is a palindrome.

- The bottleneck is still O(n⁴) but fast enough due to small limits.

### Corner cases to consider  
- One or both strings empty (handled by problem constraints).
- Both strings are identical.
- Strings have no overlapping letters.
- All letters in t or s are the same.
- Maximum and minimum string lengths.
- Palindrome is formed only from t or only from s.
- Overlapping repeated substrings.

### Solution

```python
def longest_palindrome(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    # Generate all possible substrings of s and t (including empty substring)
    def all_substrings(x):
        n = len(x)
        result = [""]
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                result.append(x[i:j])
        return result

    # Check if a string is a palindrome
    def is_palindrome(x):
        return x == x[::-1]

    substrings_s = all_substrings(s)
    substrings_t = all_substrings(t)
    max_length = 0

    # For all pairs of substrings, check their concatenation
    for s_sub in substrings_s:
        for t_sub in substrings_t:
            candidate = s_sub + t_sub
            if is_palindrome(candidate):
                max_length = max(max_length, len(candidate))

    return max_length
```

### Time and Space complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(n² \* m² \* (n + m)), where n = len(s), m = len(t).
  - All substrings: O(n²) + O(m²).
  - Pairing substrings: O(n² \* m²).
  - Palindrome check per pair: O(n + m) per candidate.
  - For n, m up to 30, total work ≈ (465 \* 465 \* 60), so about 12 million primitive ops, bearable.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n² + m² + n + m), for storing all substrings and temporary candidate strings.

### Potential follow-up questions (as if you’re the interviewer)  

- Could you optimize for cases where s and t are much longer?
  *Hint: Try to avoid generating or checking all substring pairs directly—consider dynamic programming or hashing.*

- What if you can concatenate t's substring first, then s's substring?
  *Hint: Would reversing one string and repeating the algorithm work?*

- How would you handle the case where s and t consist of unicode or multibyte chars?
  *Hint: Consider the cost and correctness of slicing and reversing with multibyte chars.*

### Summary
This problem leverages the classic **brute-force substring generation with palindrome checking** pattern, which is feasible due to small constraints (n, m ≤ 30).  
It demonstrates string manipulation, substring enumeration, and palindrome checking.  
This logic (brute-forcing over substring pairs, then checking a property) can also apply to various string concatenation and matching problems in coding interviews.
